00:07                       .           Time for negotiations...
00:12                       .           Forget it, I'm not doing it!
00:18                       .           Do it or else!
00:22                       .           I don't care about that anymore...
00:28                       .           Besides... I have a better idea...
00:32                       .           WHAT?!
00:35                       .           Enjoy the parting gift!

00:59                       Phoenix     Wright and Co. Office "Defending YOU like it's nuttin', baby"!
01:03                       .           ...No...sorry... I-I don't need a vegetable dicer...
01:09                       .           I'm sure that...ugh...
01:11       0002
01:12                       Phoenix     That silly slogan Maya came up with must be what's making business this slow, I should really have it revised...
01:19                       .           Scratch that! I NEED to have it revised! What a ridiculous slogan! Who are we trying to attract, grade school students?
01:27                       .           I guess it is a good sign though...
01:29                       .           The less people are in need of an attorney then less problems there are in the world.
01:33                       .           Unfortunately sunshine and smiles don't pay the bills.
01:36                       .           Guess I can at least call it in early tonight.
01:39       flash           .           ARGH!
01:41                       .           W-what's going on!?
01:43       flash           .           I can't move my body!
01:45                       .           (Wait, is my hand fading away?!)

02:06                       Phoenix     Ughhhhh...
02:08                       ????????    Hey! Who the heck are you?!
02:10                       Phoenix     (...Whose voice is that?)
02:12                       ????????    For that matter WHAT the heck are you?
02:15                       Phoenix     ("What am I?" What kind of question is that, does she mean my profession?)
02:20                       ????????    I wanted the best Defense Attorney in Equestria, not some... porcupine thing.
02:26                       Phoenix     (*Sigh* Does my hair really look like a porcupine...?)
02:31                       .           (My muscles are coming to, I think I can open my eyes.)
02:34       0004
02:36                       Phoenix     Huh? Where am I?
02:38       0005            ????????    Hey! You're a human, aren't you?
02:41                       Phoenix     Yeah... I'm a human...
02:43       flash           Phoenix     WAIT WHAT?!
02:45       0006            ????????    A human in Equestria, that's amazing!
02:49                       Phoenix     Y-YOU'RE A TALKING HORSE!
02:51       0007            ????????    Excuse me! I am not a horse, I happen to be a pony.
02:55       0005            Phoenix     OH! Okay! A talking PONY. That explains everything!
02:59                       .           I must be in a dream... a really REALLY bad dream.
03:03       0007            ????????    I'm pretty sure you're not, let's conduct an experiment...
03:07       flash           Phoenix     Ow! What was that for?!
03:10       0008            ????????    You acknowledged pain, therefore that definitely means you aren't dreaming.
03:14                       Phoenix     (This thing has a really sick sense of humor.)
03:17       0005            ????????    Wait... are you a defense attorney?
03:20                       Phoenix     Of course I am!
03:22                       .           (Why am I talking to it?!)
03:23       0009            ????????    Oh...oops... my mistake.
03:28                       Phoenix     What do you mean "oops"?
03:30       0007            ????????    Well, I cast a spell to call upon "The Greatest Defense Attorney in Equestria"
03:35                       Phoenix     What is Equestria?
03:37       0010            ????????    The name of this country.
03:39       0011            Phoenix     But I'm not FROM this country!
03:42       0010            ????????    I must have left out the "Equestria" part when I cast the spell.
03:45       0009            .           I guess I accidentally called upon "The Greatest Defense Attorney" period.
03:49                       .           Go figure, huh?
03:50                       Phoenix     (Oh cosmos, you flatter me.)

			Choice:
				Send me back
				Who are you?

SEND ME BACK (optional)
03:53       0005            .           Well, can you please send me back... like RIGHT NOW?!
03:57       0010            ????????    Sure thing...
03:59       0006            .           Actually... this is perfect!
04:02                       Phoenix     (Oh please don't tell me this is going where I think it is...)
04:05       0010            ????????    You see I am in need of a really good defense attorney...
04:10                       Phoenix     (... aaaaaaand it does go where I think it is...)
04:13       0006            ????????    And you just happen to be here...
04:16       0012            Phoenix     Actually, you kidnapped me with your freaky spell, remember...
04:20       0007            ????????    A minor setback...
04:22                       Phoenix     MINOR!?
04:23       0006            ????????    Yes... but would you be willing to represent my friend?
04:28       0005            Phoenix     ...Honest... I'm still shocked I am in a library talking to a purple hors-err I mean... pony...
04:33                       .           Can you just send me home, please, and get someone else to do it?
04:37       0013            ????????    Look, I really need help... my friend's life is at stake here...
(advance into WHO ARE YOU?)

WHO ARE YOU? (advances)
04:42       0005            Phoenix     Let me just get my head together. This is a little too much for me.
04:48                       .           First off, who are you and where am I?
04:50       0010            Twilight    My name is Twilight Sparkle. I'm a disciple of "Princess Celestia", the monarch of this land.
04:56                       .           I am chronicling the magic of friendship for her and you're in the town of Ponyville.
05:01       0005            Phoenix     Celestia? Magic of Friendship? Ponyville?... Wait a minute, are you saying there are more talking ponies?!
05:08       0006            Twilight    Mhm, almost all of Ponyville's inhabitants are ponies.
05:13                       Phoenix     Oh joy, this keeps getting better and better.
05:16       0010            Twilight    Hey, I know! Be right back!
05:19       0004            Phoenix     (Whoa! Is she moving books around with that horn?)
05:23       0006            Twilight    Found it! Here you go! You're new here, so you can read this... uh... "detailed" encyclopedia of the different ponies in Equestria.
05:32       0014            Phoenix     Hmmm... wait! This says it's "For early ages" on the cover!
05:36                       .           This is a children's book!
05:38       0009            Twilight    Well you see... this stuff is kind of common knowledge.
05:43       0015						Earth Ponies founded Land.\nUnicorns use magic.\nPegasi soar through the air.
05:46       0009            Phoenix     You call this detailed! I read the whole book cover to cover in ten seconds flat...
05:51       0013            Twilight    *Sigh*
05:54                       Phoenix     Hey... I'm sorry. I guess I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.
05:58                       .           (Should I have said Pony there, I wonder...)
06:00                       Twilight    No, it's not that. It's my friend... I know she is not guilty but she is going to be punished for a crime she didn't even commit.
06:08                       Phoenix     What kind of crime is she being accused of?
06:10                       Twilight    Murder...
06:13                       Phoenix     (Surprise, surprise...)
06:14                       Twilight    Murder never happens in Ponyville, or Equestria for that matter, so the punishment is very severe.
06:21                       Phoenix     What is the punishment?
06:23                       Twilight    Banishment...
06:25                       Phoenix     Well that isn't so bad compared to-
06:26                       Twilight    To the moon... or even the sun...
06:28                       .           I have convinced the Princess to go easy on her but she will have no choice if the verdict ends up being guilty.
06:33                       Phoenix     (And forget what I just said, sheesh! If being sent to the sun is "going easy on someone" then remind me never to do anything bad in this place.)
06:41                       .           So...uh...Twilight, do you know any details about the crime?
06:46                       Twilight    Not much, all I know was my friend was near the scene of the crime when the murder took place. That is why she's the prime suspect.
06:54                       Phoenix     Where is she right now?
06:56                       Twilight    In the Ponyville Detention Center.
06:58                       Phoenix     Have you spoken with her since?
07:00       0005            Twilight    I would but the guards won't let me in.
07:02                       Phoenix     They won't let you in? Why not?
07:04       0013            Twilight    I can only get in there with a Defense Attorney which is why I was trying to call one.
07:09                       Phoenix     Okay them, since I'm a Defense Attorney let's go to this Detention Center.
07:13       0006            Twilight    Really! So you'll take the case?!
07:15                       Phoenix     Hey hey... I haven't decided that yet. I just thought the lease I could do is help you get in to speak with your friend.
07:21                       Twilight    Thank you for your kindness, Phoenix Wright.
07:25       0005            Phoenix     How did you know my name? I haven't introduced myself yet...
07:28       0016            Twilight    Oh-uh... I did... uh.. a quick identification spell.
07:34                       Phoenix     Identication spell?
07:35       0010            Twilight    Yeah! An identification spell! Anyway, let me prepare a few things, then we can go to the Detension Center.
07:43       0004            Phoenix     (After I get her inside there with her friend, I'll let her off easy and make her send me back home. There is no way I'm taking a case this weird...)
07:53       0017                        Ponyville   June 9th, 10:05PM
07:59                       Phoenix     I have never felt like such a minority in my life!
08:01       0018            Twilight    Oh, it wasn't that bad.
08:03                       Phoenix     All those ponies were gawking at me the whole way here.
08:06       0019            Twilight    Mr. Wright, humans have almost never been seen in all of Equestria.
08:10       0018            .           In fact you may be the first one in Ponyville.
08:13       0020            .           You should be honored!
08:14                       Phoenix     (Honored? Strolling around a town infested with candy colored equines...)
08:19                       .           (Yeah, maybe I'd feel honored if I was... Oh, I dunno... a five year old girl!)
08:23                       .           So how did you know I was a human?
08:26       0021            Twilight    I read a lot!
08:27                       .           I've read almost every book in my library five times over and I am familiar with a lot of different species:
08:33       0020            .           Chimeras, Trolls, Basilisks, Goblins, et cetera, et cetera.
08:37                       Phoenix     (Wait!? You're telling me she has read every book in that gigantic library FIVE TIMES?!)
08:41       0019            Twilight    Anyway we're here, Phoenix.
08:44       0022            Guard       Halt! Only a lawyer can enter the detention center.
08:48       0018            Twilight    Well, go on...
08:49       0022            Phoenix     Uh... Hi guys, I'm a lawyer...
08:53                       Guard       Identification!
08:54                       Phoenix     Ah!... Right here!
08:56       0023            .           (Never leave home without it!)
08:59                       Guard       What is that?
09:00                       .           Is that a toy? You look a little old to be playing with toys.
09:04                       Phoenix     (Next time I am leaving it at home...)
09:07       0022            Guard       You cannot pass without valid Equestrian identification.
09:11                       Phoenix     But I don't have any...
09:13                       Guard       Then beat it Spiky!
09:15       0019            Phoenix     Twilight! They're not letting me in.
09:17       0020            Twilight    Oh that's right, Mr. Wright! I was supposed to give you this.
09:21       0024            .           The princess ordered me to give you this earlier today. A permit to defend in Equestria.
09:25                       Phoenix     I see... wait...
09:27       0025            .           I thought you accidentally brought me here, how could your princess have had that prepared for me?
09:32       0026            Twilight    O-oh uh What I meant was... I had my assistant Spike prepare it before we left.
09:38                       Phoenix     Spike? I didn't see anyone else in that library...
09:41       0025            Twilight    He was sleeping, it's late as you can see, I had to wake him up and have him prepare it. That's why it took a little while to leave.
09:48       0027            .           I'll properly introduce you to him later.
09:51       0028            Phoenix     You prepared a permit in twenty minutes? I find that a little fishy...
09:54       0029            Twilight    Save the questions for my friend, just take the badge!
09:58                       Phoenix     (This isn't helping me accept your request, you know...)
10:00       0030
10:04       0019            Phoenix     A heart...
10:06                       .           (I feel my masculinity going... going... gone.)
10:11       0031            Twilight    Come on, hurry up! Visiting hours are almost over.
10:15                       Phoenix     Alright, alright! No need to shove me...
10:18       0032            Phoenix     Okay... guys here it is...
10:22                       .           (This is so degrading...)
10:24                       Guard       Permission granted, you may enter.
10:27                       Phoenix     Phew... alrighty!
10:29       0019            .           Come on Twilight, you can go speak with your friend now.
10:31       0033            Twilight    Sorry Phoenix...
10:33                       Phoenix     Sorry? About what?
10:35                       Twilight    I am not allowed in, only attorneys are allowed to speak with suspects...
10:39                       Phoenix     But you said...
10:40       0019            Twilight    I know I said I'd talk to her but it'd be better if you got all the details about the crime to make your judgement.
10:47                       .           Just please hear her out... if you don't want to do it after that...
10:51       0033            .           I'll send you back to where you came from...
10:54                       Phoenix     But I-
10:56                       .           (Should I really be doing this...?)
10:58                       .           (Should I really be meddling in some other world's affair...?)
11:01                       .           (Maybe I should at least hear what all this fuss is about...)
11:04                       .           Sigh... Fine...
11:07       0020            Twilight    Thank you so much, Mr. Wright.
11:13       0034                        Ponyville Detention Center June 9th, 10:15PM
11:20                       Phoenix     Okay, so where is Twilight's friend?
11:23       0035            ????????    Hey!
11:25                       Phoenix     Eh?! What did I do?!
11:27       0036            ????????    I don't think they allow animals in here, you should get out before they toss you in here too.
11:32                       Phoenix     Look, I am not an animal. I'm a human being!
11:35       0037            ????????    Oh... I didn't mean you, I meant that thing on your head.
11:40       0036            Phoenix     (If someone makes fun of my hair ONE more time...)
11:43       0037            ????????    So I'm guessing you're my lawyer, huh?
11:45                       Phoenix     Yes, Twilight Sparkle sent me...
11:49       0036            .           Wait! No! I haven't agreed to anything yet!
11:52       0038            ????????    Jeez, Twilight knows how to pick 'em...
11:55       0036            .           What are you doing here then?
11:57                       Phoenix     I just want information regarding the crime you are being accused of.
12:00                       .           Let's start off with your name...
12:02       0039            Rainbow     I'm Rainbow Dash, best flier in Ponyville! Soon to be a household name in all of Equestria!
12:10                       .           Line up for my autograph starts over there!
12:12       0037            Phoenix     (Twilight Sparkle? Rainbow Dash?)
12:15                       .           (Is it me or are their names starting to sound like flavors of ice cream?)
12:19       0036            .           I am Phoenix Wright, best attorney in the... universe... apparently...
12:24       0040            Rainbow     Phoenix?
12:25                       .           Sweet name but it could sound cooler...
12:30       0039            Phoenix     uhh... "cooler"?
12:32       0037            Rainbow     I think I'll call you "Nix", that sounds cool!
12:36       0036            Phoenix     (Another strange name I can add to my nickname checklist.)
12:40                       .           Hmmm, so you are an... earth pony, correct?
12:43       0041            Rainbow     What the hay are you talking about? I'm not an earth pony, I'm a pegasus!
12:48                       Phoenix     Uhh... never mind that. Why are you in here?
12:53                       .           (It's kinda sad I couldn't get down a book with twelve words.)
12:57       0040            Rainbow     Well, I guess I can tell you all I know...
13:00       0036            .           You see, last night a pegasus named "Ace Swift" was killed in the Everfree Forest.
13:04                       Phoenix     Do you know anything about him?
13:07       0037            Rainbow     Sure do, he was a hot shot racer expected to win the "Equestrian 500".
13:11                       Phoenix     "Equestrian 500"?
13:13                       Rainbow     A grueling race for pegasi, enduring a five hundred mile journey around Equestria.
13:18                       .           He was the top pick to win the whole thing.
13:21       0039            .           Dont worry though...
13:22                       Phoenix     "Don't worry"? About what?
13:24       0037            Rainbow     I still would have won even if he were still alive, ha!
13:28                       Phoenix     Let me guess, you were planning on entering that race as well?
13:31       0042            Rainbow     Of course! The winner gets special lessons from the Wonderbolts!
13:37                       Phoenix     Who are "The Wonderbolts"?
13:39       0036            Rainbow     You don't know who the Wonderbolts are?
13:41       0035            .           You living under a rock or something?!
13:43                       Phoenix     Hey, I'm new here! Cut me some slack!
13:46       0043            Rainbow     *Sigh*
13:48       0041            .           "THE" Wonderbolts are only the most coolest ponies in all of Equestria!
13:53                       .           They are the Princess' personal aerial acrobatic team. The stunts they perform are nine degrees of cool!
13:59       0036            .           You see, I've been trying to get in their group forever and the Equestrian 500 is my ticket to show off my slick moves to them.
14:07       0037            .           I'd do anything to get that chance!
14:10                       Phoenix     (Thank you for effectively establishing motive for yourself, Ms. Dash, this helps your case so much...)
14:16                       .           So how did this guy die?
14:18       0036            Rainbow     Pony.
14:19                       Phoenix     Wha...?
14:20                       Rainbow     "How did this pony die?" is what you mean, Nix.
14:23                       Phoenix     (Well excuse me, I didn't take "Hooked on Ponyics")
14:26                       .           The point is, how did he die?
14:28       0040            Rainbow     How should I know? I didn't do it...
14:31                       Phoenix     Then why did they take you in?
14:33       0036            Rainbow     I just happened to be flying near the Everfree Forest that night...
14:37       0035            .           Then those chuckleheads burst into my house and brought me here, saying "I did it"!
14:41       0036            .           They even said that they had lots of proof but I would never do that to another pony!
14:45                       Phoenix     They just took you in like that?
14:47       0045            Rainbow     They said they are going to banish me...
14:50                       Phoenix     So I heard...
14:51                       Rainbow     Everyone thinks I did it, everyone!
14:55                       .           The Wonderbolts probably hate me...
14:57       0036            .           But you believe me, right?
14:59                       Phoenix     Well, I-I guess, but not everyone thinks you did it...
15:03       0040            Rainbow     Huh?
15:05                       Phoenix     Your friend Twilight seems to have faith in you, otherwise I wouldn't be in this mess...
15:08       0044            Rainbow     Heh, you're right I guess. Twilight's a real pal...
15:14       0036            .           What do you mean by "mess", anyway?
15:16                       Phoenix     You see, as you can probably guess I'm not from Equestria.
15:20                       .           Your purple friend pulled me out of my world because she accidentally called the "Greatest Defense Attorney"... and that happened to be me.
15:27       0039            Rainbow     Awesome! It's only fitting, the best pegasus ever gets the best lawyer ever!
15:34                       .           You were destined to defend me!
15:36                       Phoenix     (The ones ego is larger than Detective Gumshoe's appetite for instant noodles.)
15:40       0036            Rainbow     Nix, as much as I hate asking for help...
15:43       0044            .           Can you PAH-LEEES be my Attorney?
15:47                       Phoenix     (I feel kind of sorry for her, she sounds like she is telling the truth and I want to say yes... but should I...?)
15:53                       .           Well... oh, wait a minute!
15:56       0046            .           (I believe her but I better make sure...)
15:58       0047
16:04       0048            Rainbow     Is that a toy? You look a little old to be playing with toys, Nix.
16:10       0049            Phoenix     Look, Rainbow Dash, I am going to ask you this and I want you to tell me the absolute 100% truth!
16:15                       .           Did you have ANYTHING to do with the death of "Ace Swift"?
16:20       0050            Rainbow     I told you... I DIDN'T KILL ANYPONY!
16:23                       Phoenix     ...
16:24       0049            .           (Nothing... it's certain then. She really didn't do it.)
16:29       0036            .           Okay Rainbow Dash...
16:30                       Rainbow     What? Why did you go all silent there?
16:33                       Phoenix     I've decided to take your case, I trust you.
16:37       0039            Rainbow     Yes! Alright! I know you can do it Nix!
16:41                       Phoenix     I suppose the first thing I should do is investigate the scene of the crime for some evidence to prove your innocence. Where was it again?
16:47       0037            Rainbow     A clearing in the Everfree Forest.
16:49                       Phoenix     Everfree Forest?
16:51       0036            Rainbow     Yeah, it's about fifteen minutes from Fluttershy's house.
16:54                       Phoenix     Fluttershy... huh...
16:56                       .           (Probably another pony...)
16:57       0037            Rainbow     Well good luck Nix, you may look a little strange but you're okay in my book!
17:02                       Phoenix     ("I" look a little strange?! Coming from the "Roy G Biv" pony with wings, you look strange even by Ponyville standards!)
17:09                       .           Oh... right, there was one more question I wanted to ask you...
17:12       0040            Rainbow     Shoot!
17:13                       Phoenix     What were you doing near the scene of the crime anyway?
17:16       0045            Rainbow     Uh...
17:18                       Phoenix     Well?
17:19                       Rainbow     I-I was practicing for the Equestrian 500.
17:27       0051            .           Yep, that's what I was doing... practicing for the big race!
17:32       0052            Phoenix     (Psyche-locks... you're a bad liar. Even without this thing I can tell that you are hiding something from me.)
17:38       0038            .           Look Rainbow Dash, if I am going to defend you, you're going to need to be honest with me...
17:41       0045            Rainbow     I told you a dozen times already, I didn't do it!
17:46       0035            Phoenix     I am not saying you did it! I'm just wondering what you were doing near the scene of the crime.
17:51       0045            Rainbow     Um... well... uh-oh...!
17:55       0037            .           Looks like visiting hours are over!
17:57       0039            .           Catch ya later, Nix!
17:59       0034            Phoenix     Hey! No they aren't! There are still five minutes left!
18:02                       .           She's gone...
18:04                       .           Oh well, I probably need more information to pursue that any further anyway. As long as she didn't do it that is all I need to know for now.
18:15       0017                        Ponyville June 9th, 10:30PM
18:19       0020            Twilight    Phoenix! How did it go?
18:21       0019            Phoenix     I have decided to represent Rainbow Dash.
18:23       0020            Twilight    Oh, thank you so much Mr. Wright!
18:26                       Phoenix     She said she didn't do it and I can't turn my back on the innocent, or let them be punished for something they didn't do.
18:31       0021            Twilight    You share a very similar trait to Rainbow Dash, Mr. Wright.
18:34                       Phoenix     I do? Am I really that obnoxious?
18:37       0020            Twilight    No, you are very loyal.
18:40                       .           She probably may not have looked it, but Rainbow Dash is probably really scared about what is going to happen to her.
18:45                       .           So she needs all the support she can get right now.
18:48       0019            Phoenix     Now that you mention it, she did seem awfully chipper for someone who is the prime suspect for murder.
18:54       0033            Twilight    I can't imagine what it must be like...
18:57                       Phoenix     I have been in that place before.
18:59       0019            Twilight    "That place"?
19:00                       .           What do you mean by that, Phoenix?
19:02                       Phoenix     I have been on trial for crimes I didn't commit, I know how she probably feels.
19:07       black           Twilight    You have?
19:08                       Phoenix     It felt dark and lonely having nobody to turn to.
19:11       0053            .           Feeling as if the whole world was against me and nobody could help...
19:14       0054            .           Once when I was just a kid, my whole class accused me of stealing and we had this stupid "Class Trial".
19:20                       .           The other time was a little more serious...
19:23       0055            .           I was framed for murder by someone who I thought cared for me.
19:29                       .           I learned the hard way appearances can be deceiving...
19:33       0056            .           But I was lucky to have friends who pulled me out of that darkness.
19:37                       .           It really touched me...
19:39                       .           It's what made me decide to become a defense attorney.
19:44       0057            .           A defense attorney is someone who is there for you when times are grim.
19:47                       .           Showing you have someone who trusts and believes in you - that you are not alone.
19:51       0058            .           Smiling to the very end no matter how bad things may get.
19:59       0059            Twilight    Mr. Wright... You know, I was going to study some law and justice books and be Rainbow Dash's defense attorney myself if you declined.
20:08       0021            .           But I see now that there is some knowledge out there even books can't teach.
20:12       0020            .           It was no mistake choosing you to be Rainbow Dash's lawyer!
20:15                       Phoenix     ("Choose"? Didn't you bring me here by accident?)
20:19       0019            Twilight    So did you learn anything else from Rainbow Dash?
20:21                       Phoenix     Yes, she said the crime scene was in the clearing of the "Everfree Forest" near "Butshersty's" house.
20:26       0018            Twilight    "Butshersty"?
20:29       0020            .           Oh-oh! You mean Fluttershy!
20:32                       Phoenix     Do you know the way?
20:33       0021            Twilight    Sure do!
20:35                       Phoenix     Let's go then.
20:39       0060                        Fluttershy's Cottage June 9th, 11:16PM
20:43       0061            Twilight    Phoenix, we should stop here.
20:46                       Phoenix     Why's that?
20:48                       .           Oh! This must be "Flutterscotch's" house. We can probably question her to see if she saw anything last night.
20:53                       Twilight    Her name is Fluttershy...
20:55                       .           And those were my thoughts exactly.
20:58       0062            ???????     *Gasp*
21:00       0063            Twilight    Hey Fluttershy, meet Mr. Wright! He's Rainbow Dash's lawyer.
21:04       0064            Phoenix     Hello there, nice to meet you.
21:07       0065            Fluttershy  ...
21:10                       Phoenix     So Ponyville is a really nice place, huh?
21:14                       .           (Talk about quiet, certainly lives up to her name.)
21:18       0066            Fluttershy  *Whisper*
21:20       0067            Twilight    Oh... Oh... Okay...
21:23                       Phoenix     W-what's she saying?
21:25                       Twilight    She is saying suits and ties intimidate her.
21:28       0065            Phoenix     (Trust me, they scare me too.)
21:30       0061            Twilight    And...
21:31       0067            .           Uh... Nevermind.
21:33       0061            Phoenix     tell me! She can rest assured, she has nothing to fear.
21:37                       Twilight    Well...
21:38       0068            .           She says she is afraid if she gets too close to that pointy... "beast" on your head, it might... poke her eye out.
21:46                       Phoenix     (Seriously, the hair jokes are getting old!)
21:49       0061            .           So she isn't going to speak to me?
21:51       0067            Twilight    Sorry, she is kind of shy.
21:54       0065            Phoenix     No kidding...
21:56       0061            .           Let's go to the crime scene then. We're not going to get any info here if she is refusing to speak to me.
22:01       0069            Twilight    The crime scene is right over here, Phoenix.
22:04                       Phoenix     Okay.
22:06       0070            Phoenix     Huh?
22:08                       Fluttershy  Uh... "Phoenix"?
22:11                       Phoenix     Y-yeah, that is my name.
22:13       0071            Fluttershy  Oh my, I am so sorry, I didn't know!
22:18                       Phoenix     Know what?
22:20       0072            Fluttershy  That you were a phoenix. I have only seen one other phoenix in my life.
22:25       0073            .           This is so great, you can speak.
22:28                       Phoenix     Come again?
22:29                       Fluttershy  No wonder you look so homely and sick. Don't worry though, soon you will be able to rise from your ashes into a beautiful bird of fire!
22:38       0072            Phoenix     (Did I just get insulted?)
22:40                       Phoenix     But I'm not a...
22:41       0074            Twilight    Phoenix!
22:42                       Phoenix     What?
22:43       0061            Twilight    She is speaking to you, just go along with it.
22:46                       Phoenix     Oh, that's right...
22:47       0072            .           Yup! I'm a Phoenix, "Firefly".
22:50       0075            Fluttershy  My name is "Fluttershy", Mr. Phoenix.
22:54       0071            .           But you can call me whatever you want...
22:57                       Phoenix     Right...
22:58                       .           So Fluttershy, I take it you know about your friend Rainbow Dash?
23:01       0070            Fluttershy  Yes I do...
23:03       0065            .           Oh poor Rainbow Dash, she must be so scared right now.
23:07                       Phoenix     That's why I need your help.
23:09       0070            Fluttershy  How can I help, Mr. Phoenix?
23:11                       Phoenix     You live right near the crime scene.
23:13                       .           Did you see anything suspicious last night?
23:16       0075            Fluttershy  Why, yes, I did.
23:17                       Phoenix     That's great! Tell me everything you know!
23:21       0070            Fluttershy  Well, I saw-
23:22       0065            .           Oops... Oh, I'm so sorry Mr. Phoenix...
23:26                       .           The other ponies told me not to say a word to anyone about last night until I was on the stand.
23:31                       .           Whatever that means...
23:34                       Phoenix     Wait a minute, you're a witness!?
23:36       0075            Fluttershy  I don't even know what that is Mr. Phoenix.
23:39                       Phoenix     (You sure your name isn't "FlutterNaive"?)
23:42       0070            .           It's okay, it'll be our little secret. Just tell me what you saw.
23:47       0061            Twilight    Come on Fluttershy. We need to know.
23:49       0065            Fluttershy  I'm sorry Twilight, but I don't want those ponies to be mad at me...
23:54                       Phoenix     *sigh* Why can this never be easy?
23:58                       .           So what is it you do, Fluttershy?
24:00       0076            Fluttershy  I take care of my little animal friends, of course.
24:05       0072            Phoenix     So you're good with animals, huh?
24:07                       .           (I don't find it surprising, since she is an animal herself.)
24:12       0071            Fluttershy  Why yes, I can introduce you to them if you want...
24:16                       Phoenix     That is alright, we're kind of busy.
24:19       0065            Fluttershy  Oh my! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to bother you...
24:22                       Phoenix     It's all right... no need to apologize.
24:27       0061            Twilight    We have to get going, Fluttershy. We'll talk to you later.
24:31       0072            Fluttershy  Alright, bye Twilight! Bye Mr. Phoenix!
24:36       0061            Phoenix     At least I got her trust, it will be a little easier inevitably cross examining her when we are in court.
24:42                       .           Speaking of that... when is the trial, anyway?
24:45       0067            Twilight    Tomorrow morning.
24:47       0061            Phoenix     Oh. Tomorrow morning...
24:50       0077            .           TOMORROW MORNING!?
24:52       0061            .           As in "tomorrow" tomorrow!?
24:55       0067            Twilight    Yup. "Tomorrow" tomorrow.
24:57       0061            Phoenix     So I have only a few hours to gather evidence and present a case!?
25:01                       .           (Phoenix, what have you gotten yourself into...?)
25:04       0077            Twilight    Oh my gosh! I totally lost track of time!
25:08       0078            .           I have been trying to get a suitable lawyer all day long, I was just going to give up after you.
25:10       0061            Phoenix     Give up after me? You mean I'm not the only lawyer you have spoken with today?
25:14       0079            Twilight    That is correct. They all declined though... as soon as murder was brought up.
25:20                       Phoenix     Don't worry, murder cases aren't anything new to me. I have a lot of experience with them. Rainbow Dash couldn't be in any better hands.
25:26       0063            Twilight    Thank you again for accepting this, Phoenix!
25:29       0061            .           But we better hurry to the crime scene though.
25:31                       Phoenix     Right!
25:38       black                       Everfree Forest. June 9th, 11:30PM
25:40                       Twilight    Welcome to the Everfree Forest, Mr. Wright.
25:43                       Phoenix     Kind of spooky...
25:45                       Twilight    There are many deadly creatures in the Everfree Forest.
25:48                       .           Everypony tends to avoid entering here because of that.
25:51                       Phoenix     D-deadly creatures?
25:53                       .           A-ah! HELP! Something just touched my hand!
25:56                       Twilight    That was just my tail. Don't worry Phoenix, we aren't that deep. Most of the menacing things live much further in.
26:03                       Phoenix     Oh-oh okay.
26:04                       .           (Come on! Don't be such a chicken, Phoenix!)
26:07                       .           Look, there is a clearing... this must be it...
26:13                       Twilight    Hard to believe somepony died here...
26:15                       Phoenix     Aren't there any crime scene investigators?
26:17                       Twilight    They're probably all finished up.
26:19                       Phoenix     Bonus for me, I guess...
26:21                       .           Let's get down to work then!
26:23                       .           But there is a little problem...
26:25                       .           It's way too dark here. I can hardly see anything and I don't have a flashlight.
26:30                       Twilight    Let me take care of that.
26:34       0080            Phoenix     (It's that horn again. It's lighting up like a candle. That must be really handy.)
26:41                       .           Good work, Twilight.
26:43       0081            Twilight    Alright! Let's find some clues!
26:45                       Phoenix     (She seems really eager to start this up.)
26:47                       .           Hey! Look at this!
26:49       0080            Twilight    Why is there tape all over the grass?
26:51                       Phoenix     If it's anything like in my world, this is probably where they found Ace Swift's body.
26:55       0082            Twilight    Ugh... I think I'm going to be sick...
26:57                       Phoenix     (And all that eagerness seemed to go away in one fell swoop.)
27:01       0080            Twilight    Wait, the victim was Ace Swift?
27:03                       Phoenix     That is what Rainbow Dash told me...
27:05       0083            Twilight    Ace Swift, hmm...
27:08       0080            Phoenix     It's strange, though...
27:09                       .           There's no blood at all.
27:11                       .           Uh... ponies can bleed, right?
27:14       0083            Twilight    Of course they can!
27:16       0080            Phoenix     It's just really strange there is a murder, but not a drop of blood in sight.
27:20       0083            Twilight    This grass is odd, too. It's all black...
27:23                       Phoenix     You're right. It is all charred and burned like there was a small fire around the body.
27:29       0084
27:32       0081            Twilight    "Steel Samurai"? That sure is an interesting looking camera, Phoenix.
27:37                       Phoenix     It's not mine, it belongs to a friend.
27:39                       .           (Hey! Maybe I should tell Twilight about "The Steel Samuari". Amazing how a kids' show got so popular outside its targeted demographic.)
27:48       0080            Twilight    Hey, look there. That thing on the ground next to where the body was.
27:52       0085
27:54                       Phoenix     It's a... what the heck is this thing!?
27:57                       Twilight    I don't have any idea.
27:59                       Phoenix     Whatever it was, it's totally burnt to a crisp.
28:03       0080            Twilight    Just like the grass.
28:05                       Phoenix     This may be important evidence.
28:07       0086
28:10       0080            Phoenix     Let's look at that dirt landscape over there.
28:12       0081            Twilight    Sure thing!
28:13       0087            Phoenix     What's this?
28:16       0088            Twilight    There is an imprint of something in the dirt, something long...
28:20                       Phoenix     That isn't what I find odd...
28:21       0089            Twilight    What do you mean?
28:23                       Phoenix     Look next to it, someone obviously disturbed the dirt here.
28:26       0088            Twilight    Now that you mention it... this doesn't look natural at all. It looks like somepony was kicking the dirt around in this area.
28:33       0090
28:36       0089            Phoenix     See anything else suspicious?
28:38                       Twilight    Look at that tree way over there at the other end of the crime scene.
28:41       0091            Phoenix     It's knocked down...
28:43                       Twilight    But look at the trunk. It suffers from the same burning as the grass and that object.
28:48                       Phoenix     Can ponies breathe fire or something?
28:50       0092            Twilight    No Phoenix. Dragons do that, not ponies...
28:54       0091            Phoenix     Heh! Maybe a dragon really did do all this.
28:57       0092            Twilight    That isn't possible. Spike is the only dragon in Ponyville and he was with me all night.
29:02       0091            Phoenix     Spike...
29:03                       .           That is your assistant you told me about...
29:05                       .           Wait, he's a dragon!? There really are dragons here!?
29:09       0092            Twilight    Why, yes...
29:11       0091            Phoenix     You said you wanted to introduce me to him...
29:13                       .           I-it's quite alright. Y-you don't need to, he's p-probably a really nice guy.
29:17       0093            Twilight    Don't be so shy, Spike loves company!
29:19                       Phoenix     (gulp)
29:20                       .           (I really hope that doesn't have a double meaning to it!)
29:23       0094            Twilight    Oh Phoenix! Look on that branch there, on that tree behind the fallen one.
29:28                       Phoenix     There is something stuck on it. I'll climb up and get it...
29:31       0093            Twilight    No need, Mr. Wright.
29:35                       Phoenix     (Or you could just float it down...)
29:37       0095            .           It's a brown... feather...
29:39                       .           Well that was pointless. Probably from a bird.
29:42       0089            Twilight    No, it can't be. No bird in Ponyville is this big.
29:46                       Phoenix     I know, maybe it is the victim's. He was a pegasus, right? Maybe it is from his wings.
29:50                       Twilight    Nope, this feather doesn't belong to a pony, either. Too big.
29:55                       Phoenix     Then we should keep it.
29:57       0096
30:01       0089            Phoenix     How do you do that, Twilight?
30:03       0088            Twilight    Do what, Phoenix?
30:05                       Phoenix     I've seen you levitating things with that horn of yours.
30:08                       .           Not to mention you are lighting this whole area with it at this very moment.
30:11       0094            Twilight    It's magic. Levitation and illumination are two of the basic spells a unicorn can learn.
30:17       0089            .           Why do you ask? Is there no magic in your world?
30:20                       Phoenix     No, there isn't...
30:23                       .           Actually, you could say there is...
30:26       0093            Twilight    Please do tell. You see, magic is sort of my bread and butter, I want to learn everything there is to know about it.
30:33                       Phoenix     Well, I have been able to speak to the dead via spirit channeling. That could be considered magic, I guess.
30:38       0089            Twilight    Spirit channeling?
30:40                       Phoenix     It's when the spirit of someone who is departed possesses the body of the living.
30:44                       .           I have used it to keep in touch with someone very dear to me.
30:48       0088            Twilight    Oh, I get it...
30:50       0093            .           Hey! Phoenix, can't you do it right now? We can get Ace Swift in your body and ask who killed him.
30:56                       Phoenix     Heh, sorry. I forgot to mention you have to be a high level spirit medium in order to perform the channeling technique.
31:02       0089            .           My friend is the one who normally does it.
31:06       0088            Twilight    I see...
31:08       0093            .           Thanks for the information though. I'll definitely look into it more.
31:12       0089            Phoenix     Hmm... No decisive evidence yet. We still don't even know how this guy died.
31:17                       .           Hey, Twilight. Do you know anything about him?
31:20                       Twilight    I know a bit of information about him.
31:23                       Phoenix     All right, anything helps...
31:25                       Twilight    Well, Ace was an athlete who got extremely popular around Equestria by winning every event he's ever competed in.
31:31                       Phoenix     He won EVERY single event he's ever competed in!?
31:34                       Twilight    Yeah, he was that good...
31:36                       .           But with this streak of success he gained a few skeptics thinking that all his victories were a result of cheating and other dubious methods.
31:43                       Phoenix     I'd probably think the same if I saw someone winning at everything they do.
31:47                       .           *cough*
31:49                       Twilight    He was supposed to be competing in the Equestrian 500 and was the racer expected most likely to win.
31:55                       Phoenix     Rainbow Dash told me about that too. Unfortunately it sets up a motive for her...
32:00                       Twilight    What do you mean?
32:02                       Phoenix     Rainbow Dash said she was planning on flying in that race as well and she seemed really, well, determined on winning it.
32:09       0094            Twilight    Yes, I remember her going around Ponyville bantering how she was going to be the one to take the gold.
32:14       0089            Phoenix     If she were to rub out the guy most likely to win, she would have more of a chance of winning the whole thing herself.
32:20       0097            Twilight    But she wouldn't do that!
32:23                       Phoenix     Yes, yes I know. But we are going to have to prove otherwise to those who probably suspect that in court tomorrow.
32:29       0098            Twilight    Sorry, I guess you're right.
32:32                       Phoenix     Can't say I'm really satisfied with the evidence we gathered but this looks like all we are going to find here...
32:38       0091            Twilight    The ponies investigating the crime scene must have taken all the important stuff.
32:41                       Phoenix     I'm sure we will see it presented in tomorrow's trial. In any case, we should go get some rest.
32:47       0099            Twilight    What!? No studying or anything!?
32:50       0091            Phoenix     Don't worry, I do it all the time. If I just keep my eyes set on truth, everything will be fine.
32:55       0098            Twilight    I hope you really are the best defense attorney, Mr. Wright...
32:58                       Phoenix     We have a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
33:01       0094            Twilight    You can sleep at my house. I have an extra bed for you.
33:05                       Phoenix     (I still feel like I shouldn't be taking this case. I'm an outsider meddling in something that doesn't concern me at all...)
33:12                       .           (But at the same time, I can't turn my back on someone who is being accused of a crime they didn't commit. That just goes against everything I stand for.)
33:20                       .           (This whole thing is still really weird, talking ponies and all. But I said I would defend Rainbow Dash and that is what I am going to do.)
33:28                       .           (I need to bring my A-game tomorrow, even with little evidence. I will find the truth and get Rainbow Dash acquitted of this murder.)
