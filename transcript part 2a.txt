49:40       black
49:42       0127        Trixie      Witness, state your name and occupation.
49:46       0187
49:48       0135        Trixie      Witness! Get out from under there and state your name and occupation!
49:51       0188        Fluttershy  (*whispers*)
49:54       0130        Judge       Can you please repeat that, young lady? I couldn't hear you.
49:59       0188        Fluttershy  (*whispers*)
50:01       0130        Judge       Nope... still couldn't hear you...
50:03       0132        Phoenix     Maybe I can milk this situation to our advantage.
50:06                   Twilight    What do you mean?
50:08       0139        Phoenix     Your Honor! This witness clearly doesn't have the ability to testify. Perhaps we should suspend the proceedings of this trial for another-
50:15       0189        Fluttershy  Oh, Mr Phoenix, you're here! You haven't died yet?
50:18       0190        .           There must be something very wrong... you look so frail and seem to be suffering more than ever right now.
50:24       0134        Phoenix     You got the last part right...
50:26       0126        Judge       Mr Wright, tell her to state her name and occupation, please.
50:30       0128        Phoenix     But that's the prosecution's job. It's her witness...
50:34       0141        Trixie      This witness was being difficult when Trixie was preparing her earlier as well.
50:39       0126        Judge       Given the circumstances... just do it, Mr Wright.
50:43       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy - I mean, witness - state your name and occupation, please.
50:47                   .           (Never thought I'd be saying that line.)
50:49       0189        Fluttershy  I'm Fluttershy. I'm an animal caretaker.
50:53       0127        Trixie      Is it true you saw Rainbow Dash leave the Everfree Forest two nights ago?
50:58       0187
50:59       0126        Judge       Mr Wright...
51:01       0134
51:03                   Phoenix     Is it true you saw Rainbow Dash leave the Everfree Forest two nights ago?
51:07                   .           (This kind of backfired on me...)
51:09       0191        Fluttershy  Yes, she seemed to be in a hurry.
51:12       0130        Judge       So the defendant was indeed at the scene of the crime on the night of the murder.
51:17       0126        .           Witness! You will-
51:18       0187
51:19       0126        Judge       Mr Wright, tell her she has to testify.
51:24       0134        Phoenix     (Now I have to do your job too, Your Honor?)
51:27                   .           Fluttershy...
51:29       0189        Fluttershy  Yes, Mr Phoenix?
51:31       0139        Phoenix     Can you please testify as to what you saw two nights ago when you saw Rainbow Dash leaving the forest?
51:36       0190        Fluttershy  Umm... I don't know what 'testify' means...
51:40       0139        Phoenix     It just means tell us what you saw that night.
51:42       0189        Fluttershy  Oh yes, I can do that! Anything for you, Mr Phoenix!
51:46       0192        (boomsfx)   -- I'll tell you all what I saw! ... if it's okay with you... --
51:50       0191T       Fluttershy  It was during the night hours. I went outside to feed the chickens and the other ones...
51:57       0190T       .           When I was near my chicken coop, I heard a lightning bolt in the distance and it scared me.
52:04       0193T       .           After I finished feeding my chickens, I saw Rainbow Dash flying away from the forest like something was chasing her. I called out to her, but I don't think she heard me.
52:16                   .           I looked up but saw nothing following her.
52:19       0191T       .           That was when the police ponies arrived. They spoke with me, and I went off to bed at 10:30PM.
52:28       0176        Trixie      Hahaha! Is that isn't an airtight testimony, Trixie doesn't know what is! By Rainbow Trash's own friend no less.
52:36       0191        Rainbow     FLUTTERSHY!
52:38       0189        Fluttershy  Hi Rainbow Dash.
52:39       0126        Judge       Very well, Mr Wright, your cross-examination, if you please.
52:44       0132        Twilight    Did you see anything odd in there, Phoenix?
52:47                   Phoenix     Not really... Trixie is right.. it's kind of airtight...
52:50                   Twilight    Then what do we do?
52:52                   Phoenix     Poke holes in it until it isn't airtight anymore.
52:55       0133        Twilight    That's the spirit! I just hope Fluttershy isn't lying about anything.
52:59       0132        Phoenix     (I actually hope she's lying so I have something to work off of.)
53:02       0194
53:07       0191C       Fluttershy  It was during the night hours. I went outside to feed the chickens and the other ones...
53:13       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
53:14       0139        Phoenix     So, you say you went outside to feed your chickens, and "the other ones". What do you mean by that?
53:20       0189        Fluttershy  I'm... taking care of a lot of exotic animals right now.
53:23       0136        Phoenix     I see. How did you acquire them?
53:26       0189        Fluttershy  A zoo in Fillydelphia is, well, renovating, and they needed a place for all the animals to stay while they do it.
53:33       0191        .           They... heard about my talent with animals, somehow, and they came to me and asked me to take care of them.
53:42       0189        Fluttershy  O-of course I said 'yes', since they had lots of birdies and critters that I've never seen before, and I always like to meet new animals...
53:50       0136        Phoenix     How long have you had these animals?
53:52       0189        Fluttershy  Three days now.
53:54       0136        Phoenix     Is it hard work taking care of them all?
53:56       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
53:58       0135        Trixie      What, pray tell, does this have to do with murder?
54:01       0137        Phoenix     Well... I kind of like animals too, and...
54:03       0135        Trixie      Stop going off topic, you incompetent fool!
54:06       0139        Phoenix     (I really hate you Trixie, you know that?)
54:10                   .           (I better keep note of these exotic animals, though, something about it...)
54:13       0190C       Fluttershy  When I was near my chicken coop, I heard a lightning bolt in the distance and it scared me.
54:19       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
54:21       0139        Phoenix     You heard thunder while you were in your chicken coop?
54:23       0190        Fluttershy  Well, it was lightning...
54:25       0139        Phoenix     No, Fluttershy, thunder produces the sound, not lightning.
54:29       0143        Trixie      Wrong again, Mr Wrong...
54:31       0139        Phoenix     For the last time, Trixie, it's "Wright". Would you please stop calling me that?
54:35       0132        Twilight    Actually, here in Equestria, lightning is what produces the noise when it strikes the ground.
54:41       0139        Phoenix     That wasn't what I wanted to say, anyway. What time was it when you heard it?
54:45       0191        Fluttershy  8:40PM, on the dot.
54:47       0136        Phoenix     That's quite exact. How are you so sure?
54:49       0189        Fluttershy  It's the time I feed my chickens every night.
54:53       0134        Phoenix     Feeding chickens... at night...?
54:55       0190        Fluttershy  Midnight snack! I couldn't send them to bed without one, what if they starved to death while they were sleeping!?
55:02       0130        Judge       Oh my! I never realized the importance of midnight snacking!
55:07       0132        Twilight    That's our naive Fluttershy...
55:10                   Phoenix     (And that's my clueless Judge...)
55:12       0139        .           Are you positive it was the lightning you heard, and not something else?
55:15       0190        Fluttershy  I'm sure it was lightning, because the sound of lightning really frightens me!
55:20                   .           I remember getting scared when I heard it; I nearly dropped all of my chicken feed.
55:25       0127        Trixie      This lines up with the time of death, and when the initial lightning bolt was set off.
55:29       0193C       Fluttershy  After I finished feeding my chickens, I saw Rainbow Dash flying away from the forest like something was chasing her. I called out to her, but I don't think she heard me.
55:39       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
55:41       0139        Phoenix     How long did it take you to feed your chickens, Fluttershy?
55:44       0190        Fluttershy  Um, about 15 minutes.
55:47       0139        Phoenix     And you're saying you saw Rainbow Dash fleeing from the forest at that time?
55:50       0191        Fluttershy  Yes. I thought there was a ferocious creature chasing her, judging by how fast she was flying.
55:56       0139        Phoenix     What did you do then?
55:57       0190        Fluttershy  I called out to her at the top of my lungs so I could see what the problem was.
56:01       0136        Phoenix     And she just ignored you?
56:03       0190        Fluttershy  Yes, I don't know why... I yelled so loud, at the top of my lungs, like this...
56:07       0195
56:10       0196        Fluttershy  (softly) "Rainbow Dash, what's wrong!?"
56:14       0134
56:16                   Phoenix     Yeah... I haven't the faintest idea how she didn't hear that...
56:20       0139        .           So, you didn't see anything chasing Rainbow Dash?
56:23       0191        Fluttershy  Yes. I watched the forest until the police arrived, but I didn't see or hear anything come out of it after Rainbow Dash.
56:31       0139        Phoenix     !!??
56:33       0132        Twilight    What is it, Phoenix?
56:35                   Phoenix     I think I just found a contradiction...
56:37                   Twilight    You mean, Fluttershy is lying?
56:39                   Phoenix     I don't know why, but something she said is impossible.
56:41                   Twilight    Impossible?
56:43       0139        Phoenix     Your Honor, can you please have the witness amend that statement to her testimony?
56:46       0126        Judge       Hmmm... I don't see why not. Witness, please add your previous statement to your testimony.
56:53       0190        Fluttershy  Um... okay...
56:56       0191C       Fluttershy  I didn't see or hear anything else come out of the forest that night.
57:01       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
57:02       0139        Phoenix     Fluttershy, are you absolutely sure about this?
57:06       0191        Fluttershy  I'm sure. Not a peep or pony came out of that forest until the police came and spoke with me... then I went to sleep at 10:30PM.
57:14       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
57:16       0187
57:17       0126        Judge       Mr Wright, please don't frighten the witness.
57:21       0137        Phoenix     Right... sorry, but there is a contradiction in this testimony.
57:25       0141        Trixie      What contradiction? Everything she has said meshes with the evidence to a T!
57:30       0139        Phoenix     No, there's one thing that isn't right. Fluttershy, you said you watched the forest until the police force arrived, correct?
57:36       0187        Fluttershy  Y-yes... did I do something wrong? I'm so sorry if I did...
57:41       0134        Phoenix     Uh... no need to be sorry...
57:44       0139        .           But you didn't hear or see ANYTHING come out from the forest?
57:48       0191        FluttershyI didn't see or hear anything else come out of the forest that night.
57:53       0148        Phoenix     Then there's clearly a contradiction here... actually two!
57:57       0126        Judge       Please explain what these contradictions are, Mr Wright.
58:01       0139        Phoenix     Fluttershy should have seen someone leave the forest...
58:04       0148        .           The previous witness, Applebloom!
58:06       0130        Judge       Oh! That's right!
58:08       0161
58:09       0190        Fluttershy  But I-I didn't see Applebloom... I-I promise!
58:13       0148        Phoenix     You see, Fluttershy... you HAD to have seen Applebloom if you were really watching the forest all night...
58:13                   .           The prosecution even confirmed that there's only one way in and out of that forest... and that entrance is right by your cottage!
58:25       0172        Trixie      Ngh!
58:26       0132        Twilight    ...I don't understand, why would Fluttershy lie like this...?
58:30                   Phoenix     I don't know either. We've got to pursue this issue, otherwise we're cooked.
58:34       0190        Fluttershy  I-I don't know why, but I didn't see her...
58:38       0139        Phoenix     It's not just that; there is another thing, Fluttershy --
58:42                   .           You also stated you HEARD nothing as well. Earlier I was told lightning makes a noise when it hits the ground in Equestria.
58:49       0130        Judge       Yes, that is right, Mr Wright.
58:52       0148        Phoenix     Then why didn't Fluttershy mention hearing the second bolt of lightning?
58:55       0139        .           Fluttershy says she watched the forest until the police arrived, and they witnessed the third bolt take down a tree firsthand.
59:01       0148        .           The second lightning bolt is unaccounted for.
59:04       0190        Fluttershy  I only heard one bolt of lightning, though...
59:08       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
59:09       0135        Trixie      Maybe she just forgot about it.
59:11       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
59:13       0148        Phoenix     She stated the first bolt of lightning scared her, from which we can conclude that every bolt of lightning could have been heard from Fluttershy's cottage.
59:20       0139        .           It's very clear this witness is afraid of lightning.
59:25       0134        .           (And everything, for that matter.)
59:27       0191        Fluttershy  Yes, it's true, lightning scares me! It is so loud and scary -- 
59:34       0187        .           like that voice you just did, Mr Phoenix.
59:37       0149        Phoenix     There you go, Trixie, she would have remembered the second bolt of lightning frightening her if she had heard it.
59:42       0139        .           Also, let's not forget, Applebloom didn't mention seeing or hearing this lightning either, now that we know that the lightning could've been heard from that far away.
59:50       0130        Judge       The defense has a point.
59:52       0143        Trixie      Heh, and Trixie thinks the defense has nothing.
59:55       0130        Judge       Excuse me?
59:58       0176        Trixie      So what, she didn't see Applebloom; what does that prove? Do tell, Mr Wrong, Trixie is all ears...
00:05       0139        Phoenix     It questions the credibility of your witnesses! You said it yourself; there's only one way in and out of that forest!
00:12       0141        Trixie      Remember another thing! Anything beyond what Applebloom said after the time she heard the lightning bolt is irrelevant!
00:18       0148        Phoenix     You can't say that this is irrelevant information when your witness didn't see your other witness leave the forest!
00:23       0135        Trixie      Then tell the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie WHAT it means!
00:27       0176        .           Trixie knows one possibility, but that's up to you to say what it is, Mr Wrong. That is, if you have the guts to...
00:33       0139        Phoenix     I... I... can't...
00:36       0176        Trixie      Heh, thought so...
00:38       0197        Twilight    What is she talking about, Phoenix? You know a reason why Fluttershy didn't see Applebloom?
00:43                   Phoenix     I do, but I can't say it...
00:45                   Twilight    Why not?
00:48                   Phoenix     I just can't, Twilight. I'll be safe and just use the other contradiction as my stead for now.
00:53       0139        .           Fine, forget that! We can't overlook this second bolt of lightning, though. It could have been the real cause of death, making all this just an accident.
01:02       0141        Trixie      Didn't you hear Trixie earlier?
01:04       0139        Phoenix     Huh?
01:06       0141        Trixie      Lightning doesn't strike the same spot twice in Equestria, just as you can't divide by zero. The body was found directly under where the first bolt had struck.
01:15       0143        .           Not to mention the odds of a stray bolt of lightning hitting the victim by chance are highly improbable, especially since he was wearing a lightning-proof suit.
01:23       0132        Phoenix     I remember her bringing up this 'lightning-proof suit'...
01:27                   Twilight    It's what the pegasi wear when working with weather.
01:30                   .           Or in this case, a modified version designed for large scale races where they may encounter dangerous weather conditions.
01:35                   Phoenix     How exactly does the suit work?
01:38                   Twilight    It's a two piece suit, worn on the head and body. The fabric is made up of an effective insulator that protects pegasi from being harmed by lightning.
01:45                   Phoenix     Then how did he die if he was wearing this suit?
01:48                   Twilight    There are some parts of the body that the suit does not cover, namely certain parts of the head and neck. A precise, aimed bolt could still hit him in the sweet spots, which is what Trixie is basing her claims on...
02:00       0148        Phoenix     But it's still possible for a random bolt to hit him in one of the exposed spots!
02:04       0143        Trixie      I'm surprised you haven't realized it yet, Mr Wrong...
02:07       0139        Phoenix     Huh?
02:09       0135        Trixie      You have been babbling about Trixie's witnesses not seeing the second bolt of lightning so much that you seem to have forgotten...
02:15       0172        .           The second bolt seems to not exist at all. Trixie will be sure to have a chat with the pegasi who gave her these cloud ballistics to confirm it, Trixie assures you.
02:24       0143        .           Even if we take your silly theory into consideration, the odds of him being struck down by a random bolt of lightning are too low to be believable without having
02:32                   .           some sort of concrete proof!
02:34       0126        Judge       The prosecution's logic is very sound.
02:36                   .           The chances of a lightning bolt hitting the victim by chance are too small to hold water in this court without any proof,
02:43                   .           considering the protection he was wearing.
02:45       0151        .           Objection overruled!
02:48       0139        Phoenix     No!
02:50                   .           (Every time I make an objection she has it refuted just like that!)
02:53       0143        Trixie      Hah! Too bad, Mr Wrong.
02:57       0151        Judge       Enough! I'm afraid the defense's line has run short. Do you have anything else you would like to say, Mr Wright, before I hand down my verdict?
03:08       0139        Phoenix     (I'm going to lose if I don't do something fast!!)
03:13       0132        Twilight    Phoenix, there has got to be something we can do! It can't end like this!
03:18                   Phoenix     I know, but I need more time. I need more information!
03:23       0141        Trixie      Please Your Honor, make this quick. Trixie is starting to feel sorry for this hopeless defense team.
03:29       0198        Phoenix     (There is one thing I can do... I didn't want to do it earlier...)
03:33                   .           (But I have no choice...)
03:35       0199        .           (I need more time and evidence... this is the only way...)
03:37       0148        .           Your Honor!
03:39       0130        Judge       Yes, Mr Wright?
03:41       0139        Phoenix     The defense would like to cast suspicion on another.
03:44       0130        Judge       Another suspect?
03:46       0139        Phoenix     Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.
03:49       0197        Twilight    But who?
03:51       0143        Trixie      Is this the last bastion of Mr Wrong? Haha, let's hear it -- who is this mystery suspect?
03:57       0139        Phoenix     I am far from being done, Trixie!
04:00                   .           The suspect the defense accuses is the witness...
04:02       0148        .           Fluttershy!
04:04       0191        Fluttershy  Huh?
04:05       0132        Twilight    Mr Wright! What are you doing!?
04:07       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy is a pegasus; therefore she could have tampered with the cloud and the crime scene.
04:12                   .           And let's not forget, there was a very large time frame where Fluttershy was alone;
04:16                   .           She even stated she didn't see Applebloom leave the forest when we all know she SHOULD have!
04:21       0190        Fluttershy  B-but I was watching it the whole time... I'm not lying...
04:26       0143        Trixie      Heh...
04:27       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy also has connections with my client;
04:30                   .           She could have been the one who took the storm cloud my client was scheduled to set off, as well as gathered loose feathers to spread around the crime scene.
04:36       0190        Fluttershy  I-I didn't do that...
04:39       0200        Twilight    Phoenix! Stop this! She didn't do it!
04:42       0130        Judge       But the defendant's hoof marks were on the storm cloud, Mr Wright... how do you explain that?
04:49       0139        Phoenix     I'd be surprised if they WEREN'T there, Your Honor...
04:52       0130        Judge       Hmm, I don't follow...
04:55       0171        Phoenix     Simple. Rainbow Dash was to put those storm clouds at the eastern end of Ponyville, according to this weather schedule.
05:01       0130        Judge       Oh!
05:03       0139        Phoenix     Of course her hoofprints are there -- she was just doing her job!
05:06       0148        .           Fluttershy could have come and taken one of the clouds with marks on it, set it off and removed her own markings from the cloud...
05:12       0139        .           That is possible... right?
05:14       0141        Trixie      Yes, one could wipe a cloud... of their hoofmarks...
05:17       0148        Phoenix     Then all the more reason to suspect her!
05:20       0190        Fluttershy  I was home all day though...
05:22       0200        Twilight    Phoenix, you're supposed to be defending my friends!
05:26       0130        Judge       What about the dark forest, Mr Wright? How would this witness have been able to see in it?
05:32       0139        Phoenix     It must be like a backyard to her.
05:34                   .           She can probably navigate it from memory, just as you can probably navigate your house with your eyes closed.
05:39       0169
05:41       0126        Judge       This is a very bold claim, Mr Wright. This meek little thing looks like she wouldn't harm a fly... why would she frame her friend?
05:50       0191        Fluttershy  It's true, I have ten pet flies! Michael, Donna, Steven, Eric, Jackie...
05:58       0139        Phoenix     Easy! To cover her own guilt!
06:00                   .           Besides, as the prosecution has stated, why she did it is irrelevant; the fact still stands, she is just as suspicious as Rainbow Dash!
06:09       0200        Twilight    I-I can't believe you're saying this! I trusted you!
06:12       0126        Judge       You're going to need more proof to accuse this witness, Mr Wright. Do you have any evidence that can place her on the crime scene?
06:20       0139        Phoenix     In fact I do, Your Honor.
06:23       0148        .           This!
06:24       0130        Judge       A feather? Does it belong to her?
06:27       0139        Phoenix     No, I found this feather at the crime scene. It's way too big to belong to any bird or pegasus pony in Ponyville.
06:34       0130        Judge       Just what are you getting at, Mr Wright? How does this relate to the witness?
06:39       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy!
06:40       0188        Fluttershy  Y-yes, Mr Phoenix...?
06:42       0139        Phoenix     Do you allow any of your exotic animals to go into the Everfree Forest?
06:46       0191        Fluttershy  Oh no, it is much too dangerous in there. They're kept locked up tightly when I'm not playing with them...
06:53       0139        Phoenix     As I thought! Fluttershy stated earlier that she's caring for animals not native to Ponyville; this feather could belong to one of them.
07:00       0148        .           It could have been brought there unintentionally by Fluttershy as she framed my client!
07:04       0138        (twilight objection sfx)
07:06       0130
07:07       0141
07:08       0202        Twilight    This can't go on!
07:11       0130        Judge       The.. defense is objecting to...
07:15                   .           ITSELF!?
07:16       0202        Twilight    Yes. Mr Wright doesn't know what he's talking about! His words are nothing but slander and lies!
07:23                   Phoenix     Twilight!
07:24       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
07:25       0135        Trixie      Zip it, Twilight! You're only his co-counsel, and nothing more!
07:29       0141        .           Discrediting an attorney like that will get you held in contempt!
07:33       0202        Twilight    You're a hypocrit! You've been degrading him all day long!
07:37       0176        Trixie      And that's it. Trixie has just called Mr Wrong names -- 
07:40       0143        .           never once has Trixie accused him of lies or slander, which is a serious accusation!
07:46       0126        Judge       You are right as always, Ms Trixie. 
07:49       0169        .           Another outburst by the defense's co-council and they will be held in contempt of court.
07:53       0177        Twilight    B-but...
07:55                   Phoenix     (Trust me, I don't want to do this, Twilight... but it's the only way I can buy more time...)
07:59       0126        Judge       Back to the matter at hand... I still have a hard time believing this little pony would do something like this...
08:07       0148        Phoenix     The evidence speaks for itself, Your Honor! This feather puts Fluttershy on the scene of the crime!
08:13       0139        .           I demand further investigation to find out if this feather belongs to any of Fluttershy's animals!
08:17       0169        Judge       Hmmm...
08:20       0126        Judge       Ms Trixie, what is your opinion on all of this? You have been surprisingly quiet regarding all of Mr Wright's claims.
08:27       0141        Trixie      You know what...
08:29       0143        .           Trixie agrees, Fluttershy is suspicious.
08:32       0176        .           The investigation team did indeed see this feather on the crime scene; we brushed it off as just a plain old bird feather.
08:38       0141        .           But as Trixie's feeble opponent has pointed out, it does seem kind of big up close, and with this information regarding these zoo animals...
08:46       0190        .           ... it does seem to cast suspicion over this witness.
08:49       0126        Judge       You are aware we will have to suspend proceedings until tomorrow for further investigation...?
08:55       0135        Trixie      You don't think Trixie knows this?
08:57       0141        .           Another one of Twilight Sparkle's little friends in the slammer is reward enough for Trixie today. "Two for the price of one", as they say!
09:05       0143        .           And Trixie has you to thank, Mr Wrong!
09:09                   .           You've made this experience much, MUCH more fulfilling. 
09:12       0176        .           Perhaps Trixie will give you a voucher for her next performance.
09:14       0139        Phoenix     ...
09:16       0126        Judge       All proceedings for this case will be suspended until tomorrow.
09:20                   .           Baliff, please take the suspect into custody for questioning.
09:24       0190        Fluttershy  Wait, w-where are you taking me? I wouldn't do that to anypony... 
09:27       0156        .           Twilight, Mr Phoenix, help!
09:32       0177        Twilight    Phoenix... how could you...?
09:36       0139        Phoenix     (What have I done...?)
09:39       0126        Judge       I expect both sides will gather more evidence for tomorrow.
09:43       0176        Trixie      Trixie shouldn't need to if they are planning to keep that second rate lawyer over there!
09:48       0139        Phoenix     ...
09:50       0126        Judge       Court is now adjourned!
09:52       0125        (hammersfx)
