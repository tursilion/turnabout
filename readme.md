This is an attempt to code a game out of the old Phoenix Wright - Turnabout Storm MLP cross-over fan video.

The game plays online using a TI-99/4A with TIPI or compatible for the web access. It also supports F18A for 
better graphics.

It is built into my Classic99 emulator as well:

I'm kind of tempted to port to other platforms... just need to convert the images for each
appropriate system (and samples and music, I guess... though the VGMComp music should play on
many systems with a player, if we can port the code.)

Anyway, this is TI only today. Play using Classic99 above.

Like all my code, if you want to use it, just ask first.
