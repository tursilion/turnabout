// Phoenix Wright: Turnabout Storm - Story Data
// Story data ported from Locations.cpp (python updateStory.py ../Locations.cpp locations.js)
//
// HOW TO UPDATE STORY DATA:
// 1. Each location is a numbered key in STORY_DATA object (0, 1, 2, etc.)
// 2. Each location contains an array of story lines
// 3. Each story line has: evidence, frame, cmdwho, text
// 4. Constants (EV_*, PP_*, CMD_*) must match those defined in the main HTML file
//
// EXAMPLE STORY LINE:
// {evidence: EV_NONE, frame: 5, cmdwho: PP_PHOENIX | CMD_NONE, text: "Hello world!"}
