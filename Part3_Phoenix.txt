[00:41:45.74 - 00:41:46.74]  I want to know, Sonata, what was it like being Ace's manager?
[00:41:51.74 - 00:41:52.74]  I told you, Mr. Wright.
[00:41:53.74 - 00:41:54.74]  It's none of your business.
[00:41:55.74 - 00:41:56.74]  I'm not a Swiss man. << note for Claude - 'Swiss' is more likely Ace, related to Ace Swift
[00:41:57.74 - 00:41:58.74]  I'm not a Swiss man.
[00:41:59.74 - 00:42:00.74]  I'm not a Swiss man.
[00:42:01.74 - 00:42:03.74]  It's none of your business.
[00:42:04.74 - 00:42:07.74]  And Bingo was his name-o. I knew there was more to you than meets the eye.
[00:42:09.74 - 00:42:16.74]  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to attend to. I would appreciate it if you left my room post-haste.
[00:42:17.74 - 00:42:21.74]  That's odd. Didn't you say she was going to have us arrested for breaking and entering?
[00:42:22.74 - 00:42:23.74]  Alright, let's go Pinkie Pie.
[00:42:24.74 - 00:42:28.74]  Yep, yep. I wish you the best of luck on your investigation. You'll need it.
[00:42:28.74 - 00:42:39.74]  I was sweating bullets back there.
[00:42:39.74 - 00:42:41.74]  She's quite intimidating for a pony.
[00:42:42.24 - 00:42:45.74]  I didn't find her intimidating. I tried to make her smile. How do you think I did?
[00:42:46.24 - 00:42:48.74]  Uh... Don't quit your day job.
[00:42:49.24 - 00:42:53.24]  Okay! Wait! What is my day job anyway? Throwing parties is more of a hobby.
[00:42:53.74 - 00:42:58.24]  Pinky, you still haven't told me. How did you manage to be so late for the trial?
[00:42:58.74 - 00:42:59.74]  I slept in.
[00:43:02.74 - 00:43:03.74]  That's it?
[00:43:04.24 - 00:43:05.24]  Is something wrong?
[00:43:05.74 - 00:43:09.24]  No, I guess I was just expecting a better reason than that.
[00:43:09.24 - 00:43:15.24]  I have a bad habit of being late. That's why I don't play parties too far in advance. I'll just be late and miss all the fun.
[00:43:15.26 - 00:43:17.26]  So I just throw them whenever I want.
[00:43:17.54 - 00:43:21.70]  That says a lot about you. I thought you were a bit annoying at first.
[00:43:22.34 - 00:43:24.94]  But I can see now that you're just a...
[00:43:25.74 - 00:43:31.26]  a free spirit. Your heart's in the right place though. You've remind me a lot of a girl I know.
[00:43:31.30 - 00:43:32.98]  Aww, thanks, Feeny.
[00:43:33.00 - 00:43:37.86]  So what do you think happened, Pinkie Pie? The crime, I mean. What do you think really happened?
[00:43:37.90 - 00:43:41.90]  Let me think. Oh, oh, oh, I know!
[00:43:42.90 - 00:43:45.90]  Maybe, just maybe. Rainbow Dash?
[00:43:46.90 - 00:43:47.40]  Yes?
[00:43:47.90 - 00:43:52.90]  Maybe she has an evil twin sister nobody knows about. Yeah, so there are two Rainbow Dashes, one good, one evil.
[00:43:53.90 - 00:43:54.90]  Double Rainbow Dash?
[00:43:55.90 - 00:43:56.90]  All the way! That would be so intense.
[00:43:57.90 - 00:44:02.90]  Don't you think someone would notice two Rainbow Dashes by now? All those colors, they'd stick out.
[00:44:03.90 - 00:44:06.90]  An evil twin sister nobody knows about doesn't seem plausible.
[00:44:06.90 - 00:44:12.90]  No, Phinea, I think I'm gonna do something here. We have to find that bathroom before she starts again! Let's call her Wabniar!
[00:44:13.90 - 00:44:16.90]  Wabniar? But that's just...
[00:44:17.90 - 00:44:19.90]  Why am I even arguing about this?
[00:44:20.90 - 00:44:21.90]  Hey, look there!
[00:44:22.90 - 00:44:26.90]  Hey, you two! Did you by any chance receive a letter not posted to you?
[00:44:28.60 - 00:44:31.84]  I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-E-E-E-E-E-E-E EYES!
[00:44:33.68 - 00:44:35.92]  Have you seen an optometrist about that?
[00:44:36.16 - 00:44:38.48]  Optometrist? See me!
[00:44:38.76 - 00:44:41.42]  Oh, I mean, I mean...
[00:44:41.72 - 00:44:42.22]  Um...
[00:44:42.30 - 00:44:43.90]  Mean no-see letter?
[00:44:44.20 - 00:44:44.70]  *Sigh*
[00:44:44.94 - 00:44:46.20]  That's just great.
[00:44:46.50 - 00:44:47.20]  What's the matter?
[00:44:47.62 - 00:44:52.04]  Some airhead even important letter to the wrong pony and I'm trying to track it down.
[00:44:52.34 - 00:44:55.28]  I can't stop looking into those entrancing eyes.
[00:44:55.94 - 00:44:57.28]  Did she see all around her?
[00:44:57.62 - 00:45:00.62]  Maybe she can see through the very fabric of time and space!
[00:45:00.82 - 00:45:02.62]  Hey! I know you!
[00:45:02.82 - 00:45:03.62]  Hmph!
[00:45:03.82 - 00:45:05.82]  Guess my reputation precedes me.
[00:45:06.02 - 00:45:08.22]  Phoenix Wright, best attorney in the-
[00:45:08.32 - 00:45:11.42]  He heard that big loser lawyer from Rainbow Dash's trial!
[00:45:11.62 - 00:45:13.22]  Hey, you're famous, Beanie!
[00:45:13.32 - 00:45:15.22]  I wish I could've seen you in action!
[00:45:15.62 - 00:45:18.12]  I think the word you're looking for is infamous.
[00:45:18.42 - 00:45:21.82]  Remember that part where you didn't know Pegasus could move clouds?
[00:45:22.02 - 00:45:24.02]  Oh, how I laughed and laughed!
[00:45:24.42 - 00:45:26.22]  Except I wasn't laughing.
[00:45:26.62 - 00:45:28.62]  Look, I was just underprepared.
[00:45:29.18 - 00:45:33.42]  And in case you haven't noticed by me not being a pony, I'm not from around here.
[00:45:33.78 - 00:45:34.98]  Who are you anyway?
[00:45:35.42 - 00:45:37.12]  The name's "Dirpy Hooves".
[00:45:37.18 - 00:45:39.72]  Oh, that's kind of a cruel name.
[00:45:40.38 - 00:45:40.88]  Well, DIR-
[00:45:40.94 - 00:45:42.22]  Hey! Don't stop!
[00:45:43.14 - 00:45:45.22]  Uh, uh, just a second, will you?
[00:45:45.38 - 00:45:46.52]  What's wrong, Pinky?
[00:45:46.72 - 00:45:47.92]  Don't say her name!
[00:45:48.02 - 00:45:48.82]  Why not?
[00:45:48.92 - 00:45:52.22]  She's really, really, really, REALLY sensitive about it.
[00:45:52.32 - 00:45:54.12]  Don't say her name whatever you do!
[00:45:54.42 - 00:45:56.42]  I think it's kind of a harsh name.
[00:45:56.42 - 00:45:58.42]  But she seems okay with that.
[00:45:58.52 - 00:46:00.52]  Who doesn't that upbeat oblivious voice?
[00:46:01.12 - 00:46:04.00]  *Singing*
[00:46:04.02 - 00:46:06.42]  No, no, no, no, no. Just trust me on this one.
[00:46:06.46 - 00:46:09.92]  Fine. I'll see what the big deal is, though.
[00:46:09.96 - 00:46:11.62]  Okay, we're done. H
[00:46:11.66 - 00:46:15.96]  Well, der- I mean, uh, Blonde Main Pony?
[00:46:16.00 - 00:46:18.00]  What did you think of the trial?
[00:46:18.04 - 00:46:21.60]  Blonde Main Pony? Didn't I tell you my name?
[00:46:21.64 - 00:46:24.40]  Uh, I, uh... I...
[00:46:24.44 - 00:46:25.60]  Yes?
[00:46:25.64 - 00:46:26.64]  I...
[00:46:26.68 - 00:46:28.08]  Yes?
[00:46:28.12 - 00:46:30.12]  I... uh...
[00:46:30.12 - 00:46:31.40]  Like your mane?
[00:46:31.66 - 00:46:34.38]  Oh really? I did it up all nice this morning!
[00:46:34.58 - 00:46:36.74]  Yeah, it really looks good.
[00:46:36.98 - 00:46:42.50]  Thanks! I'd say something about your hair, but it really just looks like you stood in front of a fan for a long time.
[00:46:44.66 - 00:46:46.90]  Is this what I get for trying to be nice?
[00:46:47.62 - 00:46:51.74]  I'd like to hear about what you thought of the trial, since apparently you were there.
[00:46:52.34 - 00:46:54.74]  Oh, I was there alright! It was...
[00:46:54.86 - 00:46:57.66]  Oh, hey, I know! I'll tell you in poem!
[00:46:57.76 - 00:47:01.56]  I've been told I'm a really good poet when reciting mail carrier code.
[00:47:02.36 - 00:47:03.06]  What?
[00:47:03.66 - 00:47:07.36]  Ahem! The defense really seemed out of luck.
[00:47:07.66 - 00:47:11.06]  If you want my opinion, you really did suck!
[00:47:11.26 - 00:47:14.26]  Mr. Beard was indecisive and fickle.
[00:47:14.36 - 00:47:17.36]  Fluttershy seemed like she is in quite the pickle.
[00:47:17.56 - 00:47:21.26]  Little Apple Bloom heard that first bolt touch the ground,
[00:47:21.36 - 00:47:23.96]  but why didn't the second one make a sound?
[00:47:23.96 - 00:47:30.96]  The prosecutions put downs were quite rich, but honestly she was being a big stuck up...
[00:47:31.46 - 00:47:31.96]  ...meany.
[00:47:32.46 - 00:47:34.46]  Lava! That was really good!
[00:47:34.96 - 00:47:36.96]  Thank you! Thank you!
[00:47:37.46 - 00:47:39.96]  Actually, it really wasn't that bad.
[00:47:40.46 - 00:47:43.96]  I'd better be off now. I'll be a deep dude if I don't find that letter.
[00:47:44.46 - 00:47:44.96]  Bye!
[00:47:45.46 - 00:47:51.46]  By the way, I should warn you too. There is a nasty unicorn calling ponies terrible memes out and about.
[00:47:51.96 - 00:47:54.52]  I have a feeling that's our lovely prosecutor.
[00:47:54.64 - 00:47:56.72]  Just thought I'd warn ya. See ya!
[00:47:56.84 - 00:47:58.84]  So, did you get what you wanted from that hotel?
[00:47:58.96 - 00:48:00.84]  Yeah, it should come in handy tomorrow.
[00:48:01.28 - 00:48:03.72]  I wonder why Sonanda didn't have us arrested, though.
[00:48:04.00 - 00:48:05.24]  Maybe she likes you.
[00:48:05.32 - 00:48:08.92]  I highly doubt that. She was shooting daggers at me with her eyes.
[00:48:09.28 - 00:48:11.40]  I must have been looking the other way when I happened.
[00:48:11.48 - 00:48:15.48]  That must have been so cool! I wish I could shoot daggers from my eyes!
[00:48:15.68 - 00:48:17.20]  It's a metaphor, Pinky.
[00:48:17.88 - 00:48:20.04]  But it sort of does look that way.
[00:48:20.64 - 00:48:22.14]  Just look at my suit.
[00:48:22.64 - 00:48:24.14]  You're still upset about that?
[00:48:24.44 - 00:48:27.44]  Of course I am! This is the only one I have on me!
[00:48:27.64 - 00:48:29.64]  I can't walk into court with a ripped suit!
[00:48:29.94 - 00:48:31.64]  I look so unprofessional.
[00:48:31.94 - 00:48:33.44]  You could just go naked like me!
[00:48:33.64 - 00:48:34.44]  Gah!
[00:48:34.84 - 00:48:38.14]  Are you crazy? I'm not gonna show up in court naked!
[00:48:38.44 - 00:48:41.24]  Why not? Everybody else does it.
[00:48:41.44 - 00:48:42.64]  Uh, it's...
[00:48:42.94 - 00:48:45.54]  Oh hey! I know what to fix that for you on a jiffy!
[00:48:45.74 - 00:48:48.34]  Well, it's better than going in my birthday suit.
[00:48:48.84 - 00:48:50.24]  Who can fix this for me?
[00:48:50.24 - 00:48:51.24]  Rarity can!
[00:48:51.34 - 00:48:52.34]  Rarity?
[00:48:52.74 - 00:48:55.24]  I guess we can make a detour to get this repaired.
[00:48:55.54 - 00:48:57.74]  I feel awkward with this hole in my armpit.
[00:48:58.24 - 00:49:00.04]  There's a boutique as a free honor, Phoebe!
[00:49:00.14 - 00:49:01.14]  Hooray!
[00:49:01.64 - 00:49:04.14]  Hey! Stop running ahead of me like that!
[00:49:14.14 - 00:49:17.34]  Wow. This place is really posh.
[00:49:17.74 - 00:49:19.94]  Probably reflects the owner's personality.
[00:49:19.94 - 00:49:20.94]  Oh, visitors!
[00:49:22.94 - 00:49:24.94]  Whoa! A marshmallow pony!
[00:49:25.94 - 00:49:27.94]  Oh, it's just you, Pinkie Pie, and...
[00:49:29.94 - 00:49:30.94]  That's him!
[00:49:31.94 - 00:49:32.94]  What's the matter?
[00:49:33.94 - 00:49:34.94]  That's here!
[00:49:35.94 - 00:49:37.94]  Go ahead. Just make fun of it.
[00:49:38.94 - 00:49:40.94]  I've actually gotten used to it. What's it gonna be?
[00:49:41.94 - 00:49:42.94]  Why's there a hedgehog sleeping on your head?
[00:49:43.94 - 00:49:44.94]  That one's always a classic.
[00:49:45.94 - 00:49:47.94]  Make fun of it? Whatever do you mean?
[00:49:48.94 - 00:49:50.06]  It's fabulous!
[00:49:50.36 - 00:49:51.06]  Huh?
[00:49:51.28 - 00:49:52.88]  You like it?
[00:49:53.48 - 00:49:54.12]  Like it?
[00:49:54.44 - 00:49:55.72]  I love it!
[00:49:55.82 - 00:49:57.10]  It's so dynamic!
[00:49:57.26 - 00:49:58.14]  So intense!
[00:49:58.24 - 00:49:59.42]  So daring!
[00:49:59.58 - 00:50:01.12]  It just screams at the...
[00:50:01.44 - 00:50:03.84]  Now, what's the phrase I'm looking for?
[00:50:04.14 - 00:50:04.88]  Take that?
[00:50:05.38 - 00:50:06.26]  Take that?
[00:50:06.68 - 00:50:08.42]  Yes! It screams!
[00:50:08.58 - 00:50:09.82]  Check that world!
[00:50:09.92 - 00:50:11.92]  I can handle anything you send my way!
[00:50:12.92 - 00:50:15.42]  You must tell me who does your hair!
[00:50:15.58 - 00:50:18.00]  I'd like to use this style on some of my customers!
[00:50:18.00 - 00:50:21.00]  I sort of just style it myself in the mirror.
[00:50:21.10 - 00:50:24.10]  Then you have a natural talent for this.
[00:50:24.20 - 00:50:27.00]  Heh, thanks, here. I'm making me flesh.
[00:50:27.10 - 00:50:30.50]  Oh, and that marvelous royal blue suit of yours!
[00:50:30.60 - 00:50:32.50]  I'm most partial to purple myself,
[00:50:32.60 - 00:50:36.70]  but after setting my eyes on such a sophisticated, elegant suit like this,
[00:50:36.80 - 00:50:38.30]  I might change my mind!
[00:50:38.40 - 00:50:40.30]  It has so much character in it!
[00:50:40.40 - 00:50:42.80]  It boldly proclaims to the world!
[00:50:42.90 - 00:50:46.30]  Uh, help me out here. What's the way to say it?
[00:50:46.40 - 00:50:47.40]  Hold it?
[00:50:47.40 - 00:50:48.90]  Why yes, that's it!
[00:50:49.90 - 00:50:54.40]  I am a figure of a merchant, and you're very honest with what I have to say.
[00:50:54.90 - 00:50:57.40]  Wait, what's this?
[00:50:57.50 - 00:50:58.40]  What's wrong?
[00:50:58.50 - 00:51:00.40]  There's a giant hole in your suit!
[00:51:00.50 - 00:51:02.90]  Yeah, yeah, that's what we came here for, Barry.
[00:51:03.00 - 00:51:06.40]  This will not do! This will simply not do at all!
[00:51:06.50 - 00:51:10.40]  We can't have you walking around with this gaping hole in your suit!
[00:51:10.50 - 00:51:13.40]  It's an dignified spit in the face of fashion!
[00:51:13.50 - 00:51:14.40]  Really?
[00:51:14.50 - 00:51:18.50]  I don't like the whole much either, but it isn't that big.
[00:51:19.50 - 00:51:23.50]  No, no, it's positively huge! Give it to you right now! I must fix up your suit!
[00:51:24.50 - 00:51:28.50]  And since you're such a shop dresser and a fantastic stylist, I'll do it free of charge.
[00:51:29.50 - 00:51:30.50]  Okay, if you're offering.
[00:51:31.50 - 00:51:36.50]  Now, Mr. Feeny, let us talk. I would like to know more about you. I do enjoy some friendly discourse while I'm working.
[00:51:37.50 - 00:51:39.50]  But you're sewing. Don't you need to concentrate?
[00:51:40.50 - 00:51:44.50]  Stitching is second nature to me, and this is such a simple job.
[00:51:44.60 - 00:51:47.50]  Multitasking is my middle name, after all.
[00:51:47.60 - 00:51:49.60]  Really? Maybe some is Tabitha.
[00:51:49.70 - 00:51:56.20]  Okay, then. And please don't call me Feeny. One pony calling me that is more than enough.
[00:51:56.30 - 00:51:57.60]  What shall I call you, then?
[00:51:57.70 - 00:52:00.30]  My name's Phoenix Wright, attorney at law.
[00:52:00.40 - 00:52:05.20]  Oh, I see. So you must be that human attorney Twilight had hired.
[00:52:05.30 - 00:52:06.70]  Yeah, that's me.
[00:52:06.80 - 00:52:09.70]  You have been quite the talk of the time since this morning.
[00:52:09.70 - 00:52:10.70]  I have.
[00:52:10.80 - 00:52:15.80]  Very much so. News around Ponyville travels exceptionally fast, being so small and such.
[00:52:15.90 - 00:52:19.80]  I've heard that Twilight had brought you here from a whole other world!
[00:52:19.90 - 00:52:21.80]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:52:21.90 - 00:52:28.80]  Oh, how rude of me! I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Rarity, or Miss Rarity, if you prefer.
[00:52:28.90 - 00:52:35.90]  Nice to meet you, Rarity. I have to say, out of all Twilight's friends I've been introduced to, you seem the most mature.
[00:52:36.00 - 00:52:38.00]  Sure
[00:52:56.16 - 00:53:01.06]  What would that be? Yeah there are
[00:53:01.06 - 00:53:07.06]  Excellent! Before you go back to your world, I mean, I want to give you some of my concepts.
[00:53:08.06 - 00:53:09.06]  Your concepts?
[00:53:10.06 - 00:53:24.06]  Yes, for you see, I am a designer and an entrepreneur of sorts. I would like you to give my work to some of the ponies, you know, and ask for their opinions on them. This could really help me expand my business. Please don't tell them to be honest, though. I really need some constructive criticism.
[00:53:25.06 - 00:53:28.06]  I'll have a little trouble doing that. They don't talk.
[00:53:29.06 - 00:53:30.06]  They don't talk?
[00:53:30.06 - 00:53:34.72]  My word? What a strange world you come from, Mr. Rat.
[00:53:34.74 - 00:53:38.54]  You ponies? None of them can fly or use magic.
[00:53:38.56 - 00:53:43.46]  They don't do that either. They just sort of sit in petting zoos and perplex.
[00:53:43.48 - 00:53:45.46]  And they kind of smell.
[00:53:45.48 - 00:53:51.56]  My, my, my. Perhaps they just need a highly cultured pony from Equestria such as myself
[00:53:51.58 - 00:53:53.56]  to teach them some proper etiquette.
[00:53:53.58 - 00:53:55.96]  Or a rockin' party, live Emma.
[00:53:55.98 - 00:53:57.46]  Yeah, sure.
[00:53:57.48 - 00:54:03.34]  So if you're friends with Twilight Sparkle and Pinkie Pie here, you must be friends with Rainbow Dash
[00:54:04.56 - 00:54:07.48]  Why yes, yes, I am mr. Right and
[00:54:08.48 - 00:54:12.20]  You're aware of what's happening to her right now. Yes. I am
[00:54:13.24 - 00:54:16.28]  Don't worry very feeding I are hot in the trail of love me are
[00:54:18.28 - 00:54:24.28]  Yeah, it's very much as evil twin sister that nobody knows about rainbow - has a twin sister
[00:54:24.28 - 00:54:26.28]  You didn't know that.
[00:54:27.28 - 00:54:32.28]  Of course you didn't! Did you get to know Pony knows about part? You're a pony and you don't know! See?
[00:54:33.28 - 00:54:35.28]  Pinky, there is no evil twin sister!
[00:54:36.28 - 00:54:40.28]  But Rarity, I don't recall seeing you at the trial today. Were you there?
[00:54:41.28 - 00:54:44.28]  I wanted to go to the trial, really I did, but I couldn't make it.
[00:54:45.28 - 00:54:50.28]  Why not? Pinky Pie was late and missed it because she slept in or something. I'm sure you have a better reason.
[00:54:51.28 - 00:54:51.78]  Hey!
[00:54:52.28 - 00:54:56.78]  You see, I was expecting a package today that I'd been really anxious to get my hools on.
[00:54:57.28 - 00:54:57.78]  What was it?
[00:54:58.28 - 00:55:01.78]  A shipment of imported perfume. It was supposed to be here on my doorstep this morning.
[00:55:02.28 - 00:55:07.78]  So I went to the post office to ask why it hadn't arrived, expecting to be in and out in two shakes of a lion's tail.
[00:55:08.28 - 00:55:09.78]  And it didn't go that way, I'm guessing.
[00:55:10.28 - 00:55:10.78]  No.
[00:55:14.28 - 00:55:19.28]  The flag was so long, it was hot and stifling, no more circulation whatsoever!
[00:55:19.78 - 00:55:23.78]  The fool was crying and bickering the entire time! He entire time!
[00:55:25.78 - 00:55:29.78]  I tried to love and tolerate, but it wouldn't spin!
[00:55:29.88 - 00:55:34.78]  There was only one pen, and the pony in front of me was watching a novel or something with it!
[00:55:34.88 - 00:55:39.88]  I was sitting there for half an hour waiting for her to finish so I could sign the dumb paper what they wanted me to sign!
[00:55:39.98 - 00:55:44.38]  Wow, there were pens! Tell me, I heard there were pens!
[00:55:44.48 - 00:55:47.78]  It was absolutely dreadful! I never heard to see that place again!
[00:55:47.78 - 00:55:52.18]  I think I'm gonna need to change my pants now.
[00:55:53.18 - 00:55:59.18]  Excuse me, yes. I got a ton prostrated and lost my composure while waiting in that line.
[00:55:59.68 - 00:56:02.68]  All I wanted to do was inquire where my package was.
[00:56:03.18 - 00:56:05.98]  Dad? It sounds like you had an aneurysm.
[00:56:06.58 - 00:56:08.98]  Once you're in that line, there's no going back.
[00:56:09.18 - 00:56:14.18]  It's like they intentionally trap you, forced to endure the tedious slow-moving line.
[00:56:14.38 - 00:56:18.08]  Watching ponies write their life stories with that one pen!
[00:56:18.18 - 00:56:20.68]  Why don't they stop war pens?!
[00:56:20.78 - 00:56:22.68]  But the worst was yet to come.
[00:56:22.78 - 00:56:27.58]  They said they didn't receive my perfume, making my trip all in vain!
[00:56:27.68 - 00:56:29.58]  What do you mean by that?
[00:56:29.68 - 00:56:31.68]  It was imported from across the sea.
[00:56:31.78 - 00:56:34.78]  They said the shipment never arrived in Ponyville.
[00:56:34.88 - 00:56:36.48]  That's a shame.
[00:56:36.58 - 00:56:38.18]  Shame? Shame?!
[00:56:38.28 - 00:56:41.78]  I wasted an entire hour of my life at the horrible post office!
[00:56:41.88 - 00:56:43.98]  That was why I missed the trial!
[00:56:43.98 - 00:56:48.98]  Naturally, I complained. I was so angry! I can't believe them! The nerve!
[00:56:49.18 - 00:56:52.48]  No party should ever have to be put through the ordeal! I had to suffer!
[00:56:52.68 - 00:56:54.68]  I would enrich it on my worst enemy!
[00:56:54.98 - 00:56:57.48]  Are you getting some form of compensation for this?
[00:56:57.78 - 00:56:59.28]  No, not at all.
[00:56:59.68 - 00:57:02.98]  At the very least, they said they'd put in another shipment for me.
[00:57:03.18 - 00:57:05.48]  It will take another week to get here, though.
[00:57:06.18 - 00:57:10.18]  Oh, I know! Mr. Wright, how about I give you a copy of my invoice?
[00:57:10.78 - 00:57:12.98]  What? I thought you weren't charging me?
[00:57:12.98 - 00:57:16.38]  Oh, no, no, no, I need the invoice for my perfume.
[00:57:16.48 - 00:57:17.88]  Why would I need that?
[00:57:17.98 - 00:57:19.88]  You are a lawyer, correct.
[00:57:19.98 - 00:57:26.38]  Perhaps you can use it to sue that horrible post office for the emotional agonizing and distress I was put through today.
[00:57:26.98 - 00:57:27.88]  Eh...
[00:57:30.48 - 00:57:33.18]  That will teach them to put out more pens!
[00:57:33.58 - 00:57:34.98]  Right...
[00:57:35.38 - 00:57:38.98]  So, tell me more about this perfume you ordered.
[00:57:39.48 - 00:57:43.00]  Oh my gosh, it is simply to die for, Mr. Right!
[00:57:43.02 - 00:57:45.56]  Though I'm not that familiar with it's scent yet.
[00:57:45.58 - 00:57:47.48]  It's a rare fragrance, after all.
[00:57:47.50 - 00:57:50.36]  Like morning dew on a blooming rose!
[00:57:50.38 - 00:57:52.38]  That's the slogan!
[00:57:52.40 - 00:57:55.40]  Well, it's better than the slogan Maya thought up.
[00:57:56.22 - 00:57:58.22]  And you're getting a shipment of it?
[00:57:58.68 - 00:58:00.68]  Just one bottle, actually.
[00:58:01.10 - 00:58:03.10]  I'm looking at the invoice here and...
[00:58:03.12 - 00:58:05.52]  That's a lot of zeros for one bottle.
[00:58:05.54 - 00:58:07.54]  It's very long-lasting, you see.
[00:58:07.56 - 00:58:12.56]  The aroma lingers for days. One bottle can easily suffice for years worth of use.
[00:58:13.06 - 00:58:16.56]  You wanna wear perfume, Phoebe? You know that's for girls, right?
[00:58:17.06 - 00:58:19.06]  I can't seem to go with the pads you have!
[00:58:19.56 - 00:58:21.06]  You mean that?
[00:58:21.56 - 00:58:24.06]  Yeah, that's my Equestria attorney badge.
[00:58:24.56 - 00:58:27.56]  Please tell me at least you think it looks as good as my hair in my suit!
[00:58:28.56 - 00:58:31.06]  Compared to your suit and hair...
[00:58:31.56 - 00:58:33.06]  Uhhh...
[00:58:33.56 - 00:58:35.06]  The pink is too much, honestly.
[00:58:35.56 - 00:58:39.26]  Even the citizens of this place can see this thing looks embarrassingly stupid.
[00:58:39.46 - 00:58:42.06]  And no, Pinky. I didn't want to wear the perfume.
[00:58:42.26 - 00:58:44.46]  I was just wondering why it's so darn expensive.
[00:58:44.96 - 00:58:47.76]  Now look at that! Your suit is as good as new!
[00:58:48.16 - 00:58:51.26]  Oh wow! You really did a good job patching it up!
[00:58:51.56 - 00:58:53.26]  I can't even see where you sewed it up!
[00:58:53.76 - 00:58:56.86]  Please do take better care of your suit in the future, Mr. Rott.
[00:58:57.16 - 00:59:00.46]  But if you have any more problems with it, please don't hesitate to come to me.
[00:59:00.76 - 00:59:04.06]  I would be more than happy to take on such a fine work of art again!
[00:59:04.66 - 00:59:07.30]  Thank you. You really helped me out of a jam.
[00:59:07.42 - 00:59:10.18]  This is my only suit I have while I'm here in Equestria, you see.
[00:59:10.74 - 00:59:12.26]  You're only one?
[00:59:12.42 - 00:59:14.58]  *gasp* Idea!
[00:59:14.70 - 00:59:16.34]  How about I make you another one?
[00:59:16.50 - 00:59:19.26]  Perhaps I can encross the label with some rubies.
[00:59:19.42 - 00:59:23.90]  Red and blue go well together, but how about this might bring out the color in your eyes?
[00:59:24.02 - 00:59:25.90]  Maybe some sunglasses would match the...
[00:59:26.02 - 00:59:28.46]  dare I say, pizzazz of that hair of yours.
[00:59:28.58 - 00:59:33.30]  Royal blue really is your color, but maybe we can give you a sort of a nice purple lavender.
[00:59:33.42 - 00:59:37.18]  As I said, purple is my favorite color and I think it would look simply ravishing in it!
[00:59:37.26 - 00:59:40.06]  Uh, she seems to have gone off on a tangent.
[00:59:41.02 - 00:59:43.58]  Yeah, she'll probably be like this for about an hour soon.
[00:59:44.14 - 00:59:44.78]  Oh well.
[00:59:45.50 - 00:59:47.50]  I don't know where we should go next, though.
[00:59:48.22 - 00:59:49.18]  Fluttershy's Cottage!
[00:59:49.58 - 00:59:50.78]  Fluttershy's Cottage?
[00:59:51.02 - 00:59:52.38]  Why do you want to go there?
[00:59:52.86 - 00:59:53.74]  I don't want to go there!
[00:59:53.82 - 00:59:57.18]  The script says we go there to talk to someone and then something strange happens!
[00:59:58.86 - 00:59:59.42]  Script?
[00:59:59.98 - 01:00:00.86]  What script?
[01:00:01.66 - 01:00:04.06]  Duh! The one the voice actors are following?
[01:00:04.70 - 01:00:07.10]  Pinky, what on earth are you talking about?
[01:00:07.30 - 01:00:08.50]  What voice actors?
[01:00:08.86 - 01:00:12.06]  Like those people who do voices for characters in cartoons?
[01:00:12.34 - 01:00:15.86]  I didn't look too far into it since I don't like spoilers, you know, ruins are fun of the story!
[01:00:16.34 - 01:00:16.98]  What?
[01:00:17.34 - 01:00:19.34]  You're completely going over my head!
[01:00:19.74 - 01:00:22.34]  It says I should be going to Fluttershy's cottage, and that's where I'm gonna go!
[01:00:22.46 - 01:00:23.94]  You should come too, because it says you say,
[01:00:24.22 - 01:00:27.62]  "Why does she always run ahead of me like that? I better follow her, though."
[01:00:27.70 - 01:00:29.38]  And follow me! See you there, Peeny!
[01:00:29.86 - 01:00:30.98]  Pinky Pie, wait!
[01:00:30.98 - 01:00:35.98]  Why does she always run ahead of me like that? I better follow it though.
[01:00:36.98 - 01:00:39.98]  What? How would she do that?
[01:00:50.98 - 01:00:56.98]  Hmm, I expected there to be more police here looking into that feather. Why is it you wanted to come here again?
[01:00:57.98 - 01:00:58.98]  I forgot!
[01:00:59.48 - 01:01:01.98]  So you just brought me here for no reason?
[01:01:02.48 - 01:01:03.98]  Hey! You!
[01:01:04.98 - 01:01:05.98]  Huh?
[01:01:06.48 - 01:01:07.98]  What in tarnation do you think you're doing?
[01:01:08.48 - 01:01:10.98]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not you!
[01:01:12.98 - 01:01:14.98]  Why I ought to knock you outside the head!
[01:01:15.98 - 01:01:16.98]  Oh, you're not...
[01:01:17.98 - 01:01:19.98]  Another mistaken identity.
[01:01:20.48 - 01:01:25.98]  So tell me, Mr. Fancy Pants Lawyer, where do you get off going around accusing Sweet Little Hearty Gold Fluttershy like that?
[01:01:26.48 - 01:01:28.48]  Accusing Fluttershy, well I-
[01:01:28.58 - 01:01:30.58]  Forget it! I already know why you did it!
[01:01:30.68 - 01:01:31.38]  But you just-
[01:01:31.48 - 01:01:33.38]  You did it to buy Rainbow another day, didn't ya?
[01:01:33.48 - 01:01:36.38]  Well, yeah, I didn't want to go and blame Fluttershy.
[01:01:36.48 - 01:01:40.38]  But if I hadn't, Rainbow Dash would be getting a really strong tan right now.
[01:01:40.48 - 01:01:43.38]  I know that, but Lion are still Lion!
[01:01:43.48 - 01:01:47.38]  It's what's called a White Lie. The ones that are for good intentions.
[01:01:47.48 - 01:01:50.38]  I'm sure Fluttershy doesn't appreciate your White Lie.
[01:01:50.48 - 01:01:55.38]  Ugh, look, I'm sorry I did that to her! It wasn't even really a lie!
[01:01:55.48 - 01:01:59.48]  I just proposed the possibility, questioning Fluttershy's alibi.
[01:01:59.58 - 01:02:00.98]  Alibi?
[01:02:01.08 - 01:02:04.98]  Er, stop trying to use your fancy silver tongue lawyer speak to confuse me!
[01:02:05.08 - 01:02:07.98]  In any case, I'm gonna make everything right tomorrow.
[01:02:08.08 - 01:02:09.78]  You're Apple Bloom's sister, right?
[01:02:11.08 - 01:02:12.98]  Huh? How'd you know that?
[01:02:13.08 - 01:02:14.78]  Take a wild guess, partner.
[01:02:14.88 - 01:02:18.98]  Oh, right. The accent. Is it really that noticeable?
[01:02:19.08 - 01:02:21.78]  Hey! Are you making fun of the way I speak?
[01:02:21.88 - 01:02:23.98]  No, of course not!
[01:02:24.28 - 01:02:26.28]  But who is this with you?
[01:02:26.48 - 01:02:28.48]  Big Macintosh.
[01:02:28.88 - 01:02:29.88]  Her brother.
[01:02:29.98 - 01:02:31.98]  Oh, so your siblings.
[01:02:32.88 - 01:02:34.88]  You better make everything right tomorrow.
[01:02:35.18 - 01:02:37.18]  Or like I said, I'll knock you upside the head.
[01:02:37.48 - 01:02:41.68]  Don't worry. Me and Pinkie Pie have found some evidence that's definitely going to come in handy.
[01:02:42.08 - 01:02:43.68]  Yep, that's right, Uncle Jack.
[01:02:43.78 - 01:02:46.68]  That reminds me. Why weren't you at the trial today, Pinkie Pie?
[01:02:47.18 - 01:02:49.68]  Between you and me and Rarity, I'm the only one who showed up.
[01:02:49.88 - 01:02:50.88]  I slipped in.
[01:02:52.88 - 01:02:53.88]  That's it?
[01:02:53.88 - 01:02:57.88]  Get...fattened, habit! We gotta have a better excuse than that!
[01:02:58.88 - 01:03:01.88]  Oh? Okay! I sent you an extra, extra virus!
[01:03:03.88 - 01:03:07.88]  We spoke with Rarity, and she kind of...uh...got held up in traffic.
[01:03:08.88 - 01:03:15.88]  That just goes to show you that Applejack is the most dependable corner there is. All the same, rain or shine. I mean, got a trophy to prove it. Right, big man?
[01:03:16.88 - 01:03:23.88]  Yup. A trophy for being dependable? I wish I had a trophy. I never even got one when I was in the Little League.
[01:03:24.88 - 01:03:29.88]  So I know you're Appleboom's elder sister, but I don't know anything about you besides that.
[01:03:30.88 - 01:03:32.88]  Name's Applejack. Proud owner of Sweet Apple Acres.
[01:03:33.88 - 01:03:34.88]  Sweet Apple Acres?
[01:03:35.88 - 01:03:40.88]  Oh yeah, you're not from this neck of the woods, are you? It's an apple farm run by the Apple family, ten minutes due south from here.
[01:03:41.88 - 01:03:45.88]  With a name like Applejack, I guess you would set up a berth to be put in that business.
[01:03:45.88 - 01:03:50.88]  I'm not here to talk about that though. I don't know if you've seen that sister of mine.
[01:03:51.88 - 01:03:54.88]  No. Last time I saw her was when she was on the stand today.
[01:03:55.88 - 01:03:59.88]  I've been with Fina all day. Oh, except when I was asleep. That it was with General Cake and Major Muffin.
[01:04:00.88 - 01:04:02.88]  Major Muffin?
[01:04:03.88 - 01:04:06.88]  I had a dream. I was committing a tally of sweets, fighting off an army of salads, varieties, and broccoli.
[01:04:07.88 - 01:04:11.88]  It was like nutrition versus sweets. I had to recite them on a list on it first, but I ended up going to the DC side.
[01:04:12.88 - 01:04:17.88]  We need to come to the shops and shop where chips last their lives, but we triumph in the end!
[01:04:18.88 - 01:04:21.88]  A point would have a field day with Pinkie Pie.
[01:04:22.88 - 01:04:24.88]  So why are you looking for Apple Bloom?
[01:04:25.88 - 01:04:29.88]  She's supposed to be serving her grounded. You know, after going in at four so late.
[01:04:30.88 - 01:04:33.88]  We got a little troublemaker ran off as soon as she was excused from the trial.
[01:04:34.88 - 01:04:35.88]  She was supposed to wait for me.
[01:04:36.88 - 01:04:38.88]  By the way, I have to thank you, Phoenix Rat.
[01:04:39.88 - 01:04:43.88]  weren't you just threatening to knock me outside the head just a minute ago?
[01:04:44.88 - 01:04:49.88]  Yeah, I still want to do that. But I have to thank you for getting my little sister to tell the truth on that there stand.
[01:04:50.88 - 01:04:55.88]  Yup. You sure have an extensive vocabulary there, Big Macintosh.
[01:04:56.88 - 01:05:02.88]  I don't know if Twilight told you, but I represent the element of honesty and I would like to see my kin follow suit, if you know what I mean.
[01:05:03.88 - 01:05:04.88]  Element of honesty?
[01:05:05.88 - 01:05:11.38]  Ah, Lance Laughter, it's like the best one ever. What's the matter? Do you want to know when it's too rainy? We can think of one for you.
[01:05:11.88 - 01:05:12.38]  Uh-huh.
[01:05:13.38 - 01:05:16.38]  Uh, Sugarcube? I don't think it works like that.
[01:05:17.38 - 01:05:22.38]  Hmm, what element could you be? Oh, oh, oh, oh, I got it!
[01:05:23.38 - 01:05:26.88]  Phoenix Wright with his nifty do represents the spirit of...
[01:05:27.38 - 01:05:28.38]  Hair Gel!
[01:05:29.38 - 01:05:30.38]  No comment.
[01:05:31.38 - 01:05:35.38]  Old Beardy came by the farm and told me in Big Mac that he saw Applebrew with Twilight.
[01:05:36.38 - 01:05:39.38]  Old Beardy? Oh, you must mean the judge.
[01:05:40.38 - 01:05:42.38]  What's he doing wandering around his place?
[01:05:43.38 - 01:05:44.38]  I wonder what Applebrew's doing with Twilight.
[01:05:45.38 - 01:05:46.38]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:05:47.38 - 01:05:52.38]  The last time I saw Twilight, she was as peeved as you were at me about that little incident in the courtroom.
[01:05:53.38 - 01:05:54.38]  Oh, she'll get over it.
[01:05:55.38 - 01:05:57.38]  That is, if you honestly intend on setting things right.
[01:05:58.38 - 01:05:59.38]  Right?
[01:06:00.38 - 01:06:04.90]  set things right. My name is Phoenix right after all.
[01:06:08.90 - 01:06:14.06]  That wasn't funny. Yeah, Phiney, you really need to have more variety.
[01:06:15.30 - 01:06:18.10]  Am I the only one who thinks that joke is funny?
[01:06:18.34 - 01:06:21.98]  I may want to knock down new ones, but I'll be rooting for you anyway.
[01:06:22.42 - 01:06:27.02]  Your rainbows only help right now and I hate to see her get vanished. She doesn't deserve that.
[01:06:27.06 - 01:06:32.12]  I know for a fact she didn't kill anyone and no matter what I'll make everyone see that truth
[01:06:32.34 - 01:06:40.10]  That's the spirit. You may be any bad as a media activate. I'd like to confirm something Applejack shoot partner about Applebloom
[01:06:40.30 - 01:06:43.14]  Did she really arrive at home when she said she did?
[01:06:43.86 - 01:06:49.04]  After nine, that's when she got home. She got scolding from Big Mac and I for going into the forest so late
[01:06:51.22 - 01:06:56.58]  Spolding from him. What did he do? Yup her into submission? Why do you wait?
[01:06:56.58 - 01:07:01.58]  It's just that this second lightning bolt has been plaguing my mind.
[01:07:01.60 - 01:07:05.60]  How is it both your sister and Fluttershy didn't hear or see it?
[01:07:05.62 - 01:07:09.62]  I was thinking that his Pegasus family intercepted it before it touched the ground.
[01:07:09.64 - 01:07:12.64]  But that makes one of your comfort fiction do-hickeys.
[01:07:12.66 - 01:07:15.66]  Contra-fiction? You mean contradiction.
[01:07:15.68 - 01:07:18.68]  Yeah, one of those. You couldn't hit him because of that suit.
[01:07:18.70 - 01:07:22.70]  I was thinking the same thing. But according to Rainbow Dash,
[01:07:22.72 - 01:07:25.72]  That's who makes you completely invulnerable to lightning while in the air.
[01:07:26.72 - 01:07:28.72]  Not to mention it would have made a sound, and left the mark.
[01:07:29.72 - 01:07:30.72]  If it hit him on the ground where he was vulnerable.
[01:07:32.72 - 01:07:34.72]  Well, this thing can make my head hurt.
[01:07:35.72 - 01:07:37.72]  I couldn't hold a match for the prosecution today,
[01:07:38.72 - 01:07:41.72]  but things are going to be different now that I've had time to get a better grasp of the situation.
[01:07:42.72 - 01:07:46.72]  Speaking of that, you gotta show that stuck-up attention horse a thing or two for me.
[01:07:47.72 - 01:07:48.72]  A tension horse?
[01:07:49.72 - 01:07:50.72]  You know, it had no good blue snake in the grass.
[01:07:51.72 - 01:07:54.12]  Oh, you must mean Trixie.
[01:07:54.22 - 01:07:58.62]  Yeah, her. She's a great example of what lion will lead to.
[01:07:58.72 - 01:08:03.12]  Her fibbing and ponytails cause that big ol' nurse to come stompin' through a ponytail.
[01:08:03.22 - 01:08:05.12]  Twilight told me a bit about that.
[01:08:05.22 - 01:08:10.62]  I can't stand her. I was biting my tongue every time she opened that big mouth of hers on the trial today.
[01:08:10.72 - 01:08:14.42]  I've noticed Trixie has that effect on a lot of ponies in these parts.
[01:08:14.52 - 01:08:19.32]  She's just doing this whole thing because she's all salty with Rarity, Twilight, Rainbow and I.
[01:08:20.22 - 01:08:23.50]  Wait a minute. I knew she had a grudge against Twilight.
[01:08:23.66 - 01:08:25.34]  But why you and the other two?
[01:08:25.46 - 01:08:29.94]  Last time Trixie was in Ponyville, she was showing off and branding like she was the bee's knees.
[01:08:30.06 - 01:08:32.58]  So the others and I called Trixie out on her hootie.
[01:08:32.70 - 01:08:34.06]  Turns out we were right.
[01:08:34.18 - 01:08:36.18]  She was a great powerful after all.
[01:08:36.30 - 01:08:37.82]  So I ended up proving it.
[01:08:38.26 - 01:08:42.70]  In fact, I told that with Bloom to call Trixie out if she gave her a hard time in the trial today.
[01:08:42.82 - 01:08:45.46]  Oh, so you're responsible for that?
[01:08:45.58 - 01:08:46.98]  Guilty as charged.
[01:08:47.10 - 01:08:52.10]  Hehe, that was pretty entertaining, watching Trixie get verbally served by a child.
[01:08:52.30 - 01:08:53.90]  Certainly brightened up my day!
[01:08:54.10 - 01:08:55.30]  I know, right?
[01:08:55.50 - 01:08:57.40]  But isn't Trixie a performer?
[01:08:57.50 - 01:09:00.80]  Isn't she supposed to show off and blow things out of proportion?
[01:09:01.10 - 01:09:05.70]  I don't think the decent and sort of powerful Trixie would really attract a crowd.
[01:09:05.90 - 01:09:10.70]  Not defending her or anything, as there were times I wanted to smack her upside the head.
[01:09:10.90 - 01:09:12.50]  No, you don't understand.
[01:09:12.70 - 01:09:15.10]  Remember how she was calling you Mr. Mount Rat today?
[01:09:15.30 - 01:09:17.30]  It was like that, only on stage.
[01:09:17.50 - 01:09:19.80]  Actually, she was calling me Mr. Wrong.
[01:09:20.00 - 01:09:22.30]  You know, because it's the opposite of right and...
[01:09:22.40 - 01:09:25.00]  Same difference. All it is, it was just unbearable.
[01:09:25.30 - 01:09:27.30]  I want you to do your best, Phoenix Wright.
[01:09:27.40 - 01:09:29.10]  Show her what Ponyville is made of.
[01:09:29.60 - 01:09:33.30]  Prove Rainbow is innocent and rubbing in that smoke's not a show I face of hers.
[01:09:33.60 - 01:09:34.10]  Deal.
[01:09:34.30 - 01:09:35.10]  Let's shake on it.
[01:09:35.20 - 01:09:35.70]  Okay.
[01:09:37.80 - 01:09:38.70]  Well, go on.
[01:09:38.80 - 01:09:40.00]  I'm not touching that hoof.
[01:09:40.10 - 01:09:40.80]  Why not?
[01:09:41.00 - 01:09:42.70]  Because there's spit all over it.
[01:09:43.40 - 01:09:44.90]  You're just as prissy as really.
[01:09:44.90 - 01:09:50.94]  Don't want to get your pants pants all your hands dirty, eh? I think we can conclude this agreement with a nod
[01:09:52.10 - 01:09:55.96]  Finally I miss the mosey on now partner. I gotta find out a little fear
[01:09:56.70 - 01:10:01.30]  I'm gonna go check Twilight's place if you do see Apple Bloom. Could you tell her to go on home?
[01:10:01.94 - 01:10:04.32]  Want her running out in the battle murders happening in all?
[01:10:04.98 - 01:10:10.94]  She's with father so I suppose I shouldn't be worried. Yeah, we'll be sure to if we see her. Thank you
[01:10:10.98 - 01:10:12.10]  Oh
[01:10:12.14 - 01:10:14.78]  Well, I'm gonna give you a knock-up side of the head when I'm not so busy.
[01:10:15.26 - 01:10:15.76]  Later!
[01:10:16.46 - 01:10:18.78]  What a pleasant way to say goodbye to someone.
[01:10:19.90 - 01:10:21.98]  Goodbye, Applejack. Goodbye,...
[01:10:22.14 - 01:10:23.90]  ...Mmm... Big Macintosh.
[01:10:24.54 - 01:10:25.44]  Yup.
[01:10:26.30 - 01:10:28.86]  Was that the reason you wanted me to come here, Pinky?
[01:10:29.18 - 01:10:30.54]  To speak with Applejack?
[01:10:31.02 - 01:10:32.70]  No, it wasn't that.
[01:10:32.94 - 01:10:34.86]  There should be another reason.
[01:10:34.94 - 01:10:36.38]  Oh! Here it comes!
[01:10:36.78 - 01:10:37.28]  Huh?
[01:10:37.82 - 01:10:38.32]  [Giggles]
[01:10:38.62 - 01:10:39.50]  What's coming?
[01:10:39.98 - 01:10:40.62]  I cost!
[01:10:40.78 - 01:10:41.50]  And?
[01:10:41.50 - 01:10:43.90]  That means something strange is going to happen!
[01:10:44.00 - 01:10:46.10]  Pinkie Pie, we've been through this already.
[01:10:46.20 - 01:10:48.20]  You can't predict things based off of...
[01:10:50.00 - 01:10:50.50]  What?
[01:10:51.00 - 01:10:51.50]  What?!
[01:10:52.50 - 01:10:53.50]  Ooh, what's that?
[01:10:53.60 - 01:10:55.50]  I've never seen one of those things before.
[01:10:55.60 - 01:10:56.70]  That's a catchy tune!
[01:10:56.80 - 01:10:58.30]  But that's impossible!
[01:10:58.40 - 01:11:00.00]  How could someone be calling me?
[01:11:00.60 - 01:11:02.50]  So, what do you do with that thing anyway?
[01:11:02.80 - 01:11:05.00]  I guess I just answer it.
[01:11:05.70 - 01:11:08.30]  I hope trans-dimensional columns don't hurt my phone mill.
[01:11:09.00 - 01:11:09.90]  He-Hello?
[01:11:10.50 - 01:11:11.50]  Phoenix, right?
[01:11:11.80 - 01:11:13.00]  Yes, that's me.
[01:11:14.20 - 01:11:15.20]  Who is this?
[01:11:15.50 - 01:11:17.00]  A concerned friend.
[01:11:17.20 - 01:11:18.70]  A concerned friend?
[01:11:18.90 - 01:11:20.90]  A friend? Tell them I say hello!
[01:11:21.20 - 01:11:23.60]  Tell me, how and why are you phoning me?
[01:11:23.70 - 01:11:25.00]  I want to help you.
[01:11:25.20 - 01:11:25.90]  How?
[01:11:26.50 - 01:11:28.50]  I want to help you win the trial tomorrow.
[01:11:29.10 - 01:11:32.40]  I have some evidence for you that can clear your client indefinitely.
[01:11:33.00 - 01:11:35.50]  What? Are you serious?
[01:11:35.70 - 01:11:39.80]  Yes, I want you to meet me at the clearing, where the crime took place.
[01:11:39.80 - 01:11:42.80]  Alright, I'll be right there. Pinky, we have to-
[01:11:42.84 - 01:11:43.34]  Alone.
[01:11:43.76 - 01:11:44.26]  Huh?
[01:11:44.42 - 01:11:47.42]  We must meet alone. There's no other way I can see you.
[01:11:47.68 - 01:11:48.34]  Why?
[01:11:49.84 - 01:11:51.84]  I might get lost if I go in there alone.
[01:11:52.52 - 01:11:54.02]  Do you want my help or not?
[01:11:54.30 - 01:11:56.30]  Okay, okay, I'll go in alone.
[01:11:56.76 - 01:11:58.76]  Good. I'll be waiting for you.
[01:11:59.40 - 01:12:01.40]  You made the right choice, Phoenix, right?
[01:12:01.66 - 01:12:03.26]  Tell me though, who is this?
[01:12:05.54 - 01:12:06.54]  I'll be waiting for you.
[01:12:08.00 - 01:12:09.20]  Who are you talking to, Phoenix?
[01:12:09.20 - 01:12:15.24]  This seems a bit shady. Someone wants to meet me alone in the forest, but he said he wanted to help me
[01:12:15.92 - 01:12:17.92]  How is he calling me anyway?
[01:12:18.32 - 01:12:20.32]  Equestria doesn't seem to have cell phones
[01:12:23.24 - 01:12:26.52]  Pinky I'm sorry, but I have to go solo here. Huh?
[01:12:26.56 - 01:12:32.20]  I just got a lead that could win me the trial tomorrow, but whoever I was speaking to wants to meet me alone
[01:12:32.84 - 01:12:34.84]  That sounds kind of suspicious
[01:12:34.88 - 01:12:36.88]  Hey, I know who that was!
[01:12:37.12 - 01:12:38.00]  Really?
[01:12:38.24 - 01:12:42.24]  Yes! It was Wabniar! Planning to do something nasty!
[01:12:42.44 - 01:12:44.64]  Pinky, there is no Wabniar!
[01:12:44.84 - 01:12:48.04]  Besides, this person was male, and they said they wanted to help me.
[01:12:48.34 - 01:12:49.24]  Oh, they did?
[01:12:49.84 - 01:12:53.04]  No, that changes everything! Alright, I'll wait for you by the entrance.
[01:12:53.34 - 01:12:54.74]  I'll be right back out.
[01:12:55.04 - 01:12:58.54]  The pathway more or less leads to that clearing, and the sun's still out.
[01:12:58.84 - 01:13:01.04]  I shouldn't have trouble navigating myself through.
[01:13:01.34 - 01:13:03.94]  Be careful in there, Feeny. It's pretty dangerous.
[01:13:04.24 - 01:13:07.14]  Okay, I'll be right back. Promise.
[01:13:07.14 - 01:13:07.16]  (

[01:13:14.66 - 01:13:15.66]  (
[01:13:18.66 - 01:13:20.66]  Hello, I'm here.
[01:13:23.30 - 01:13:25.30]  Where is this mysterious friend of mine?
[01:13:25.86 - 01:13:27.86]  He said he'd be waiting for me.
[01:13:29.50 - 01:13:31.50]  It's me, Phoenix Wright.
[01:13:31.54 - 01:13:33.54]  You said you wanted to help me.
[01:13:35.34 - 01:13:37.34]  Is this someone's idea of a prank?
[01:13:37.98 - 01:13:41.34]  Hey, I know! I'll just hit the redial button on my phone!
[01:13:47.06 - 01:13:49.06]  What? No connection point?
[01:13:50.10 - 01:13:52.66]  Then how was he able to call me earlier?
[01:13:54.02 - 01:13:56.82]  Maybe all these trees are just interfering with the signal.
[01:13:59.26 - 01:14:01.66]  I'll wait five more minutes. Then I'm leaving.
[01:14:01.90 - 01:14:03.26]  This is getting creepy.
[01:14:03.26 - 01:14:23.26]  [Music]
[01:14:28.26 - 01:14:30.92]  (camera clicks)
[01:14:34.02 - 01:14:35.10]  - Oh, my head.
[01:14:37.14 - 01:14:40.54]  Did anyone get the license plate number of that truck?
[01:14:42.54 - 01:14:44.34]  Oh, where am I?
[01:14:44.36 - 01:14:45.70]  I'm still in the forest,
[01:14:45.74 - 01:14:48.24]  but I'm not in the clearing anymore.
[01:14:48.28 - 01:14:50.38]  Dammit, it was a trap!
[01:14:50.40 - 01:14:52.28]  Now I'm lost.
[01:14:52.30 - 01:14:54.08]  I need to get out of here.
[01:14:54.12 - 01:14:56.54]  This must be how Apple Bloom felt the other day.
[01:14:56.58 - 01:14:57.62]  Even though the sun's still out,
[01:14:57.62 - 01:14:59.62]  I can hardly see.
[01:15:00.12 - 01:15:02.12]  Wait a minute.
[01:15:02.22 - 01:15:05.22]  What? Where is it? All my evidence is gone.
[01:15:05.32 - 01:15:09.32]  Ah! Someone must have taken it while I was knocked out!
[01:15:12.32 - 01:15:14.32]  Hello?
[01:15:19.32 - 01:15:21.32]  Ah!
[01:15:24.12 - 01:15:26.12]  Nice puppies.
[01:15:26.12 - 01:15:33.12]  I'm frozen in place. I'm too scared to move. They're going to attack me.
[01:15:38.12 - 01:15:39.12]  No!
[01:15:46.12 - 01:15:52.12]  You should be ashamed of yourselves. Be a poor, innocent, defenseless Mr. Phoenix like that.
[01:15:53.12 - 01:15:54.12]  Fluttershy?
[01:15:54.12 - 01:15:57.40]  You two are acting like a pair of big, mean bugs!
[01:15:57.44 - 01:16:00.44]  What would your mother think if they saw you behaving this way?
[01:16:02.44 - 01:16:06.12]  I don't believe this! This can't be the same cowardly little pony!
[01:16:06.68 - 01:16:10.68]  No, I want the two of you to go back home and think about what you've done!
[01:16:15.12 - 01:16:17.12]  That was close, Mr. Phoenix.
[01:16:17.16 - 01:16:21.56]  Those species of little pines are known to rip their prey apart within a few seconds.
[01:16:22.56 - 01:16:26.56]  Fluttershy, thank you! You saved my life!
[01:16:27.56 - 01:16:35.56]  Oh, you don't have to worry about that. Even if you had been killed, you would have come back to life from your ashes more magnificent than ever, right?
[01:16:38.56 - 01:16:40.56]  Hehe, yeah.
[01:16:41.56 - 01:16:48.56]  Fluttershy, listen. The reason I accused you earlier... I know you didn't do any of that garbage I was spouting.
[01:16:49.56 - 01:16:54.58]  to buy another day to clear Rainbow Dash's name. Though I had good intentions, I did
[01:16:54.58 - 01:16:58.58]  at your expense without your saying the matter. I'm sorry I did that.
[01:17:00.58 - 01:17:03.58]  It's alright, Mr. Phoenix. I forgive you.
[01:17:04.58 - 01:17:06.58]  You forgive me? Just like that?
[01:17:07.58 - 01:17:13.58]  Yes. I believe in you. That's why I came in here to look for you, to make sure you were safe.
[01:17:14.58 - 01:17:20.58]  You're too kind. But Fluttershy, what are you doing in here? I thought you were arrested.
[01:17:21.58 - 01:17:23.58]  The police let me go.
[01:17:23.78 - 01:17:26.78]  They let you go? But I thought you were a suspect.
[01:17:27.08 - 01:17:31.58]  I don't know why. They just said I didn't have to stay anymore and let me out.
[01:17:31.88 - 01:17:35.58]  That can only mean one thing. The feather didn't match any of our animals.
[01:17:35.88 - 01:17:42.58]  When I got home, I saw Pinkie Pie standing by the entrance to the forest and I asked her what she was doing.
[01:17:43.08 - 01:17:48.58]  She said you're waiting here all alone. So I got worried and I came in here to find you.
[01:17:49.08 - 01:17:53.08]  Did you by any chance see anyone else in here while you were looking for me?
[01:17:53.58 - 01:17:55.08]  No, I didn't.
[01:17:56.08 - 01:17:58.08]  Um, should I have seen someone?
[01:17:58.58 - 01:18:01.08]  You know, like, how I should have seen Applebloom that night?
[01:18:01.58 - 01:18:04.08]  I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to do something wrong again.
[01:18:05.08 - 01:18:10.08]  It's funny how she just took on two savage wolves, and then she goes back into submissive wimp mode.
[01:18:10.58 - 01:18:11.58]  No, it's okay.
[01:18:12.08 - 01:18:15.08]  It's just someone knocked me out and put me in the middle of this forest.
[01:18:15.58 - 01:18:18.08]  Oh my, that's not very nice.
[01:18:18.08 - 01:18:23.08]  On top of that, they stole all my evidence I was gonna use to defend Rainbow Dash in the trial tomorrow.
[01:18:24.08 - 01:18:28.08]  Um, but Twilight said she was going to defend Rainbow Dash tomorrow.
[01:18:29.08 - 01:18:31.08]  Huh? What?
[01:18:32.08 - 01:18:37.08]  She talked with me at the detention center earlier and told me to forget about you.
[01:18:38.08 - 01:18:43.08]  Oh no. I hope she's not doing what I think she is. She's gonna fire me for what I did to you.
[01:18:44.08 - 01:18:46.08]  Trixie will eat her alive as she plans to defend Rainbow Dash.
[01:18:47.08 - 01:18:51.08]  Why are you talking about that blue unicorn in the wizard outfit?
[01:18:51.18 - 01:18:55.88]  Yeah, I was barely holding my own against her, and I have experience.
[01:18:55.98 - 01:18:59.98]  Twilight won't stand a chance. I have to get her to reconsider.
[01:19:00.08 - 01:19:04.38]  I'm sure if you tell her what you told me, she'll change her mind.
[01:19:04.48 - 01:19:06.98]  I don't know. She was pretty bummed out.
[01:19:07.08 - 01:19:09.48]  Then I'll help you explain it to her.
[01:19:09.58 - 01:19:13.98]  Thanks, Fluttershy. Hey, wait a second. I just slaughtered something.
[01:19:14.08 - 01:19:15.88]  What is it, Mr. Phoenix?
[01:19:15.98 - 01:19:18.70]  You said Pinkie Pie is standing by the entrance, right?
[01:19:19.08 - 01:19:20.58]  Um... yeah...
[01:19:21.28 - 01:19:26.20]  Well, whoever knocked me out would have to leave through the entrance, since that's the only way out.
[01:19:26.78 - 01:19:30.92]  Oh, I see now! Since Pinkie Pie is waiting by the entrance...
[01:19:31.18 - 01:19:34.54]  Pinkie Pie will probably see whoever attacked me exit the forest.
[01:19:34.88 - 01:19:38.58]  I'll show you the way out. You were right about that this morning.
[01:19:39.08 - 01:19:39.68]  Huh?
[01:19:40.08 - 01:19:45.48]  Even if I may not like visiting it much, this forest really is like a backyard to me.
[01:19:45.48 - 01:19:47.48]  Alright, leave the way.
[01:19:57.04 - 01:19:59.04]  Do I hear galloping?
[01:19:59.36 - 01:20:01.36]  It's not me.
[01:20:01.88 - 01:20:03.48]  It's getting closer.
[01:20:03.68 - 01:20:05.68]  I can see some pony coming this way.
[01:20:05.88 - 01:20:09.28]  One of the two attacked me. I really hope I don't have to fight a pony.
[01:20:12.48 - 01:20:13.48]  Fluttershy?
[01:20:13.68 - 01:20:14.48]  Phoenix?
[01:20:14.48 - 01:20:16.48]  Uh, hey ya.
[01:20:18.48 - 01:20:24.48]  Look, I know you really must not like me after what I did today, but I can explain.
[01:20:25.48 - 01:20:30.48]  Mr. Phoenix is only trying to help Twilight. He never meant to hurt anyone.
[01:20:31.48 - 01:20:34.48]  Let's go back to the library. I don't think it's a good idea to stay in this forest.
[01:20:35.48 - 01:20:36.48]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:36.48 - 01:20:50.12]  So that's why I did that. I know it wasn't fair to Fluttershy, but if I had just sat there and done
[01:20:50.14 - 01:20:56.34]  nothing, Rainbow Dash would have been found guilty right there on the spot. I see. Do you still want
[01:20:56.36 - 01:21:05.78]  to fire me? How did you- Fluttershy told me. Look, I don't mind if you do, but I have to warn you,
[01:21:05.78 - 01:21:12.74]  Trixie's one tough customer. I underestimated her. Despite all my experience, she managed to trump everything I threw at her.
[01:21:12.98 - 01:21:18.46]  In fact, she could have easily overruled my feather theory, since it was all just theory.
[01:21:19.42 - 01:21:20.58]  What?
[01:21:20.60 - 01:21:24.64]  I have a feeling the only reason she let me do that was to see another one of your friends in jail.
[01:21:25.14 - 01:21:30.50]  She's gonna go all out tomorrow. So if you'd like to take over, I have to warn you about that.
[01:21:31.30 - 01:21:33.10]  I don't know what I should do.
[01:21:33.12 - 01:21:38.12]  If you really want to defend Rainbow Dash, at least allow me to do one more thing for you.
[01:21:38.22 - 01:21:41.22]  You still want to help? Even though I was going to fire you?
[01:21:41.32 - 01:21:45.32]  I'll do all I can to help someone who's being accused of a crime they didn't commit.
[01:21:45.42 - 01:21:48.42]  I know for a fact Rainbow Dash didn't do anything wrong.
[01:21:48.52 - 01:21:52.02]  And I know a certain pony who knows more than she's letting on.
[01:21:52.12 - 01:21:55.02]  Actually, I do too.
[01:21:55.12 - 01:21:59.02]  Phoenix, tell me. That thing you mixed in the evidence earlier.
[01:21:59.12 - 01:22:02.02]  That wasn't a good luck charm, was it?
[01:22:02.12 - 01:22:03.24]  Why do you ask?
[01:22:03.40 - 01:22:06.20]  Let's just say I've been seeing a lot of locks today.
[01:22:07.40 - 01:22:08.60]  Locks and...
[01:22:09.00 - 01:22:09.56]  ...uh...
[01:22:10.04 - 01:22:10.84]  ...chains?
[01:22:11.44 - 01:22:12.88]  See, I knew you knew!
[01:22:13.00 - 01:22:14.96]  What was that thing and what did it do to me?
[01:22:15.56 - 01:22:17.16]  Okay, I'll be honest.
[01:22:17.24 - 01:22:20.20]  'Cause if I don't, I bet you'll see them around me.
[01:22:20.76 - 01:22:21.80]  I'm listening.
[01:22:22.36 - 01:22:24.76]  You see, it's called a magatama.
[01:22:24.92 - 01:22:29.00]  A tool I use to see if people are hiding deep secrets from me.
[01:22:29.16 - 01:22:30.68]  But don't get me wrong!
[01:22:30.80 - 01:22:32.80]  I only use it when I'm investigating crimes.
[01:22:33.68 - 01:22:34.68]  Deep secrets?
[01:22:35.60 - 01:22:39.68]  If someone's keeping a deep secret, psychic barriers called psych locks will appear.
[01:22:40.12 - 01:22:42.12]  The more locks, the deeper the secret.
[01:22:42.64 - 01:22:45.12]  If you break those locks using proof and evidence,
[01:22:45.36 - 01:22:49.36]  chances are the person, or in this case, the pony, will spill the beans.
[01:22:50.08 - 01:22:51.08]  Interesting.
[01:22:51.92 - 01:22:54.16]  Interesting? I thought you'd be mad.
[01:22:54.68 - 01:22:55.84]  What about black ones?
[01:22:56.20 - 01:22:58.04]  Black ones? What do you mean?
[01:22:58.88 - 01:22:59.68]  They were...
[01:22:59.68 - 01:23:06.68]  Never mind. So, do you know how that thing's power got transferred into me?
[01:23:06.70 - 01:23:10.98]  Not a clue. It probably had something to do with the way it reacted when you picked it
[01:23:11.00 - 01:23:16.38]  up. Hmm. Well, I'm sure I can fix it. But I need it right now.
[01:23:16.40 - 01:23:20.06]  But, since I told the truth, I expect the same from you.
[01:23:20.08 - 01:23:24.90]  What? You're not a very good liar, Twilight. I could clearly see that you bringing me here
[01:23:24.92 - 01:23:29.46]  was no accident. You did it on purpose, didn't you?
[01:23:29.46 - 01:23:31.46]  I'm... that lying, huh?
[01:23:32.10 - 01:23:36.34]  Yeah, you're about as thin as Kleenex. I mean, identification spell?
[01:23:36.84 - 01:23:42.44]  I know you have magic here and all, but that sounds like something a third-grader came up with. I know that isn't a real spell.
[01:23:43.38 - 01:23:47.90]  I was told not to say anything, but I suppose I owe you an explanation.
[01:23:48.98 - 01:23:51.90]  Princess Celestia herself told me to summon you and play dumb.
[01:23:52.46 - 01:23:55.18]  So you knowing my name and having that badge prepared?
[01:23:55.70 - 01:23:59.94]  Yeah, she did all that. I didn't know you were going to be from another world, though.
[01:24:00.94 - 01:24:04.74]  That's a bummer. So I'm not the greatest defense attorney in the universe?
[01:24:05.24 - 01:24:07.62]  Darn. I was starting to like that title.
[01:24:08.14 - 01:24:09.54]  But how does she know me?
[01:24:10.48 - 01:24:12.54]  I'm a bit sketchy on that detail as well.
[01:24:12.74 - 01:24:17.08]  I too found it really odd how she knew so much about you and how she was boasting about how good you were,
[01:24:17.16 - 01:24:20.54]  yet you acted as if you had never met a pony in your life before me.
[01:24:21.08 - 01:24:23.08]  How does this princess character know me?
[01:24:23.66 - 01:24:26.06]  I think I want to have a chat with your Highness about this.
[01:24:26.86 - 01:24:29.66]  Well, I certainly don't like the fact that I was being deceived by you.
[01:24:30.36 - 01:24:32.26]  But I thank you for telling me the truth.
[01:24:32.76 - 01:24:33.76]  I apologize.
[01:24:33.96 - 01:24:35.96]  I was just doing what the princess told me to.
[01:24:36.86 - 01:24:38.76]  She seems genuinely sorry about it.
[01:24:39.46 - 01:24:40.86]  I shouldn't hold it against her.
[01:24:41.16 - 01:24:42.96]  Perhaps I should just change the subject.
[01:24:43.36 - 01:24:43.86]  Hmm.
[01:24:44.16 - 01:24:45.46]  So this evidence you found.
[01:24:45.66 - 01:24:46.86]  Seems he had a good turni-
[01:24:47.26 - 01:24:47.76]  Oh-
[01:24:48.76 - 01:24:49.26]  Ah!
[01:24:49.86 - 01:24:50.66]  What's the matter?
[01:24:50.96 - 01:24:52.36]  The other half of the letter!
[01:24:52.76 - 01:24:55.36]  The other half of the letter? Wait, you have it?
[01:24:55.46 - 01:24:57.76]  Yeah, I found it with Pinkie Pie today.
[01:24:58.36 - 01:25:01.36]  This is my letter stating my permanent leave of absence.
[01:25:01.66 - 01:25:05.26]  After the Equestria 500 is over, I can no longer work with you.
[01:25:05.56 - 01:25:09.26]  We made quite the team, but I can't live with the guilt any longer.
[01:25:09.56 - 01:25:11.96]  I can't keep helping you ruin others' lives.
[01:25:12.06 - 01:25:16.26]  It saddens me beyond belief that we must part ways, but I must say farewell.
[01:25:16.86 - 01:25:20.36]  Goodbye, Ace. May our paths cross in the future.
[01:25:21.96 - 01:25:23.96]  Someone was quitting their job?
[01:25:24.00 - 01:25:26.00]  Yeah, and I think I know who.
[01:25:26.04 - 01:25:27.04]  Who?
[01:25:27.08 - 01:25:29.08]  I'll tell you once I confirm my suspicion.
[01:25:29.12 - 01:25:32.12]  You said you had someone you wanted to talk to, right?
[01:25:32.16 - 01:25:34.16]  Perhaps we should go our separate ways again.
[01:25:34.20 - 01:25:36.20]  You're right.
[01:25:36.24 - 01:25:38.24]  Come back here once you're done though.
[01:25:38.28 - 01:25:40.28]  You were attacked after all.
[01:25:40.32 - 01:25:42.32]  You have my word.
[01:25:42.32 - 01:25:48.32]  (Music)
[01:25:57.32 - 01:25:58.32]  Hello?
[01:25:59.32 - 01:26:00.32]  Hello, Sonata.
[01:26:01.32 - 01:26:02.32]  What do you want?
[01:26:03.32 - 01:26:04.32]  I just wanted to talk. That's all.
[01:26:05.32 - 01:26:08.32]  I already spoke to you. Can you please leave?
[01:26:09.32 - 01:26:13.88]  Be grateful I didn't tell the police about you and your friend's intrusion today.
[01:26:13.90 - 01:26:17.88]  Funny you should say that, because I was wondering why you didn't.
[01:26:17.90 - 01:26:21.80]  If you had me arrested, there would be no defense attorney tomorrow,
[01:26:21.82 - 01:26:24.80]  meaning Rainbow Dash would be most likely found guilty.
[01:26:24.82 - 01:26:29.14]  In other words, exactly what you want.
[01:26:29.16 - 01:26:30.80]  I'm not here about that though.
[01:26:30.82 - 01:26:34.30]  I just wanted to talk to you about a question you were avoiding earlier.
[01:26:34.32 - 01:26:36.30]  What was it like being Ace's manager?
[01:26:36.32 - 01:26:37.80]  Take that!
[01:26:37.80 - 01:26:44.80]  A question like that is none of your business.
[01:26:47.44 - 01:26:52.80]  Now let's see what you're hiding, Sonata. By the sound of it, it seems it wasn't good
[01:26:52.82 - 01:26:53.58]  at all.
[01:26:53.60 - 01:26:59.58]  I can't believe this! Shouldn't you be investigating the crime? Why are you bothering me with your
[01:26:59.60 - 01:27:01.76]  annoying questions?
[01:27:01.78 - 01:27:04.28]  Because I think you have something to do with all this.
[01:27:04.30 - 01:27:07.68]  Really? Me? Tell me, Mr. Wright.
[01:27:07.68 - 01:27:10.84]  Why do you think I'm involved with this crime?
[01:27:10.88 - 01:27:12.58]  I'll show you why, Sonata.
[01:27:12.62 - 01:27:13.62]  Take that!
[01:27:14.62 - 01:27:16.12]  This look familiar to you?
[01:27:17.16 - 01:27:18.56]  Where did you get that?
[01:27:18.58 - 01:27:22.76]  Seems someone who was working with Ace was planning on quitting after the race.
[01:27:22.80 - 01:27:25.16]  And I think that someone is you, Sonata.
[01:27:25.20 - 01:27:28.66]  You're the only one working with Ace and Ponyville at the moment.
[01:27:28.70 - 01:27:29.70]  Yeah.
[01:27:32.00 - 01:27:34.14]  You think I wrote this?
[01:27:34.18 - 01:27:37.04]  I've never seen this letter before.
[01:27:37.04 - 01:27:40.64]  For all you know, it could have been nailed here by Ace's butler.
[01:27:41.24 - 01:27:44.74]  No. I don't think you wrote this. I know you wrote this.
[01:27:45.04 - 01:27:46.84]  Care to explain how?
[01:27:47.44 - 01:27:49.54]  You see, it's very simple actually.
[01:27:49.74 - 01:27:53.24]  We can just compare the writing to something I know for a fact you did write.
[01:27:53.74 - 01:27:55.24]  And I have it right here.
[01:27:55.34 - 01:27:56.24]  Take that!
[01:27:57.34 - 01:28:00.14]  This unicorn spell book I found in this very room.
[01:28:00.54 - 01:28:03.04]  Are you saying I wrote this book?
[01:28:03.54 - 01:28:04.54]  Of course not.
[01:28:04.94 - 01:28:07.54]  But this book has some interesting characteristics.
[01:28:08.14 - 01:28:09.74]  I can't read a single word of it.
[01:28:10.64 - 01:28:13.04]  Then why are you showing it to me?
[01:28:13.14 - 01:28:15.34]  It probably belongs to the hotel.
[01:28:16.04 - 01:28:17.84]  No, it doesn't belong to the hotel.
[01:28:18.24 - 01:28:20.84]  I know a unicorn who reads a book just like this
[01:28:21.54 - 01:28:25.34]  and says it's only available in Canterlot, the place you say you're from.
[01:28:27.34 - 01:28:28.04]  Whatever.
[01:28:28.44 - 01:28:29.54]  It's my book.
[01:28:29.84 - 01:28:31.94]  What exactly are you trying to prove here?
[01:28:32.44 - 01:28:33.34]  Like I said,
[01:28:33.44 - 01:28:36.44]  I can't read any of the characters written inside these pages.
[01:28:36.54 - 01:28:38.04]  Except these ones.
[01:28:39.24 - 01:28:40.74]  Continue from here.
[01:28:41.04 - 01:28:43.24]  I can read that note scribbled on the page.
[01:28:43.64 - 01:28:45.74]  You couldn't find a bookmark, could you, Sonata?
[01:28:47.74 - 01:28:50.64]  I'm sure if we compare the writing in here to that letter,
[01:28:50.74 - 01:28:52.24]  we'll get a perfect match.
[01:28:53.94 - 01:28:55.74]  Fine! I wrote the letter!
[01:28:58.04 - 01:29:01.04]  But you still fail to prove any relevance to this.
[01:29:02.14 - 01:29:03.04]  So what?
[01:29:03.04 - 01:29:08.04]  I was going to quit. Why do you think I have something to do with this?
[01:29:08.24 - 01:29:13.04]  I can't help ruin others' lives. I wonder what that could mean.
[01:29:14.04 - 01:29:18.04]  I won't play dumb, because I know exactly what this little statement means.
[01:29:21.04 - 01:29:26.04]  Is this some kind of joke? Why are you showing me these pictures?
[01:29:26.24 - 01:29:31.04]  I found out earlier today, from my client. Ace was doing something very wrong to her.
[01:29:32.04 - 01:29:37.54]  And I think you know all too well what it was. You were in on this blackmailing business, weren't you?
[01:29:37.56 - 01:29:40.78]  It fits perfectly with the context of your resignation letter.
[01:29:45.04 - 01:29:48.18]  You certainly have a wild imagination, Mr. Wright.
[01:29:48.80 - 01:29:56.28]  Blackmail? Really? Even if your client was being blackmailed, what makes you think Ace and I were behind it?
[01:29:56.30 - 01:29:58.30]  I know it's the truth, Sonata.
[01:29:58.60 - 01:30:03.60]  Is that so? I don't see anything mentioning blackmail on this letter of mine.
[01:30:04.60 - 01:30:05.60]  And those pictures of my client?
[01:30:06.60 - 01:30:10.60]  Maybe Ace just needed a good laugh at his competition to get in the right mindset.
[01:30:11.60 - 01:30:16.60]  I don't think so. Ruined others' lives kind of fits the description of blackmail.
[01:30:17.60 - 01:30:22.60]  You could mean anything. You have no proof Ace and I were blackmailing anypony.
[01:30:23.60 - 01:30:24.60]  Actually, I do.
[01:30:25.60 - 01:30:26.60]  How?
[01:30:27.60 - 01:30:28.60]  Take that!
[01:30:29.60 - 01:30:30.60]  That?
[01:30:31.60 - 01:30:33.60]  This is the letter Rainbow Dash was blackmailed with.
[01:30:34.60 - 01:30:35.60]  Demands right from the horse's mouth.
[01:30:36.60 - 01:30:39.60]  Like I said, there is no way you can prove Ace or I wrote this.
[01:30:40.60 - 01:30:42.60]  It doesn't even have a name on it.
[01:30:43.60 - 01:30:45.60]  I don't need a name. There's an easier way to find out who wrote this.
[01:30:46.60 - 01:30:47.60]  What?
[01:30:48.60 - 01:30:53.60]  Just like earlier, let's compare the writing style on this blackmail letter to your letter of resignation.
[01:30:54.60 - 01:30:56.60]  They seem to match up perfectly, Sonata.
[01:30:56.60 - 01:31:03.16]  Lisanata. Would you have any idea why? There's also that list I found on your
[01:31:03.18 - 01:31:08.66]  table. With 835 next to Rainbow Dash's name, the same time requested to meet her
[01:31:08.68 - 01:31:09.68]  on this letter.
[01:31:11.68 - 01:31:16.18]  Well done, Mr. Wright. I guess there is no way to deny it anymore.
[01:31:16.20 - 01:31:17.20]  [Doorbell rings]
[01:31:18.70 - 01:31:20.70]  [Doorbell rings]
[01:31:25.30 - 01:31:26.30]  Uh...
[01:31:26.34 - 01:31:27.34]  Problem?
[01:31:27.38 - 01:31:28.94]  Shouldn't you be worried?
[01:31:28.98 - 01:31:29.98]  Worried?
[01:31:30.02 - 01:31:31.02]  *laughs*
[01:31:31.46 - 01:31:33.86]  Whatever should I be worried about?
[01:31:33.90 - 01:31:35.30]  I found you out!
[01:31:35.34 - 01:31:37.30]  You were blackmailing my client!
[01:31:37.34 - 01:31:40.70]  That's a crime, Miss Cold Hard Swift Justice!
[01:31:40.74 - 01:31:43.22]  Do you remember what I said earlier?
[01:31:43.26 - 01:31:44.26]  *Ding*
[01:31:44.50 - 01:31:45.58]  My talent.
[01:31:45.62 - 01:31:47.54]  My eye for detail.
[01:31:47.58 - 01:31:51.70]  It's what I've been using the whole time Ace and I have been doing this.
[01:31:53.54 - 01:31:54.86]  For example,
[01:31:54.86 - 01:32:01.50]  The days I studied Miss Rainbow Dash, I could see that she had quite an ego and reputation.
[01:32:01.52 - 01:32:05.08]  That's why I took those photographs of her.
[01:32:05.10 - 01:32:09.00]  We had quite the lucrative business set up, Ace and I.
[01:32:09.02 - 01:32:14.90]  We have several gamblers placing large sums of money on him after we...
[01:32:14.92 - 01:32:18.54]  have our way with a potentially tough competition.
[01:32:18.56 - 01:32:23.42]  Then split the money 50/50 on top of what he's awarded for winning.
[01:32:23.44 - 01:32:31.20]  That's why your client was targeted. Her performance at the Cloudsdale Young Flyers competition.
[01:32:31.24 - 01:32:33.00]  Why are you telling me all this?
[01:32:33.04 - 01:32:45.04]  To prove that I'm not worried at all. You see, I can get anyone to keep their mouth shut once I find out what makes them tick. You're no exception.
[01:32:45.08 - 01:32:46.44]  What?
[01:32:46.48 - 01:32:53.28]  Mr. Wright, I'm not worried in the slightest, because you're not going to tell a soul about
[01:32:53.30 - 01:32:54.30]  this.
[01:32:54.32 - 01:32:57.80]  You're wrong. I'm going to tell the police about this right away.
[01:32:57.82 - 01:33:02.70]  With my conversations with you, I can tell you hold your loyalty and your client in high
[01:33:02.72 - 01:33:03.72]  regard.
[01:33:03.74 - 01:33:06.82]  So what? You can't take that away from me.
[01:33:06.84 - 01:33:07.84]  Or can I?
[01:33:07.86 - 01:33:16.00]  If I so much as even catch wind of you uttering the word "blackmail" to anybody, I'll report
[01:33:16.00 - 01:33:19.00]  which you and your little accomplice did earlier.
[01:33:19.02 - 01:33:21.02]  She must mean how it broke into her hotel room.
[01:33:21.04 - 01:33:25.02]  You'll find it a little hard defending your client from a prison cell.
[01:33:25.04 - 01:33:29.04]  You had no jurisdiction searching my hotel room,
[01:33:29.06 - 01:33:33.04]  and you and that pink pony left Prince all over the place.
[01:33:33.06 - 01:33:37.04]  I have more than enough evidence to take you down with me.
[01:33:37.06 - 01:33:41.04]  It would be troublesome if information regarding my dealings got out,
[01:33:41.06 - 01:33:44.04]  and you wanted to defend your client, correct?
[01:33:44.06 - 01:33:46.06]  Seems we're at a stalemate.
[01:33:47.06 - 01:33:49.06]  Why didn't you just report me earlier?
[01:33:50.06 - 01:33:56.06]  Simple. I held the cards so I knew I could use them to my advantage, which I am right now.
[01:33:57.06 - 01:33:59.06]  So, do we have a deal, Mr. Wright?
[01:34:00.06 - 01:34:02.06]  I'll take your silences, yes.
[01:34:03.06 - 01:34:09.06]  Don't worry. I'll be at the trial tomorrow to make sure you keep our little secret to yourself.
[01:34:11.06 - 01:34:15.06]  Goodbye, Mr. Wright. Please go away and don't come back.
[01:34:17.06 - 01:34:21.06]  Looks like I ended up on the same boat as all our other victims.
[01:34:22.06 - 01:34:27.06]  What do I do? Though this seems important, how does it fit in with anything?
[01:34:37.06 - 01:34:45.06]  Seems Twilight isn't back yet. Better not tell her about Sonata, unless it's necessary. Not only for my sake, but for hers as well.
[01:34:48.06 - 01:34:49.06]  Hey, an owl!
[01:34:50.06 - 01:34:51.06]  You, you're an owl!
[01:34:52.06 - 01:34:54.06]  You mean, who am I?
[01:34:55.06 - 01:34:57.06]  Phoenix Wright, with a P-H and a W.
[01:34:58.06 - 01:35:02.06]  You know, you make Big Macintosh look like a blabbermouth.
[01:35:05.06 - 01:35:06.06]  Oh, you're back!
[01:35:06.06 - 01:35:10.06]  You're Spike, right? I remember meeting you earlier.
[01:35:11.06 - 01:35:13.06]  When I heard he was a dragon, I thought he'd be much bigger.
[01:35:14.06 - 01:35:15.06]  Honey's just a little guy.
[01:35:16.06 - 01:35:19.06]  Yeah, I remember. You were being a big drama queen this morning.
[01:35:20.06 - 01:35:23.06]  Sorry about that. Getting one hour of sleep will do that to you.
[01:35:24.06 - 01:35:25.06]  So what's this owl doing here?
[01:35:26.06 - 01:35:31.06]  That's Owlicious. He helps Twilight with her late night study session since he's nocturnal.
[01:35:32.06 - 01:35:33.06]  Owl-wishes, huh?
[01:35:34.06 - 01:35:35.50]  You, you're Aloysius.
[01:35:35.56 - 01:35:36.06]  Who?
[01:35:36.98 - 01:35:41.38]  Sometimes I keep at it hoping he'll say "what", "why", "where", or "how".
[01:35:41.82 - 01:35:43.14]  So you're Twilight Scribe.
[01:35:43.62 - 01:35:44.12]  Yep!
[01:35:44.52 - 01:35:46.12]  Number one assistant Spike.
[01:35:46.42 - 01:35:46.92]  Who?
[01:35:47.42 - 01:35:49.26]  Oh, so are you actually...
[01:35:49.46 - 01:35:52.56]  Would you mind being the number 1.5 assistant?
[01:35:52.66 - 01:35:54.18]  I mean, that's still number one.
[01:35:54.38 - 01:35:54.98]  Sorta.
[01:35:55.22 - 01:35:59.10]  It's just number one assistant sounds a little better on me.
[01:35:59.22 - 01:35:59.72]  Who?
[01:36:00.30 - 01:36:00.80]  Me.
[01:36:01.02 - 01:36:01.52]  Who?
[01:36:01.94 - 01:36:03.22]  Me, Spike!
[01:36:03.22 - 01:36:05.22]  You know my name?
[01:36:06.22 - 01:36:14.22]  Spike, you're not gonna win. Twilight wasn't lying when she said she likes reading. She lives in this library. It's like a bookworm's dream come true.
[01:36:15.22 - 01:36:18.22]  Yeah, hehehe. Twilight's a total nerd.
[01:36:19.22 - 01:36:20.22]  Excuse me?
[01:36:21.22 - 01:36:24.22]  Back, Twilight! I, um...
[01:36:25.22 - 01:36:28.22]  I was just on my way to, um...
[01:36:29.22 - 01:36:33.22]  Organize those awesome books my intelligent and smart friend reads!
[01:36:35.22 - 01:36:36.22]  Uh, later!
[01:36:37.22 - 01:36:39.22]  Did you find out what you needed to know?
[01:36:40.22 - 01:36:43.22]  Yes, I'll fill you in about it tomorrow. I have a good idea who's behind all this.
[01:36:44.22 - 01:36:47.22]  Okay. Wait, so you're not firing me?
[01:36:48.22 - 01:36:52.22]  I thought about it, and I realize now that you mean well.
[01:36:52.24 - 01:36:56.24]  And if what you say is true, you stand a better chance against Trixie than I do.
[01:36:56.26 - 01:37:00.26]  Please, just tell me when you're going to do something like you did today.
[01:37:00.28 - 01:37:04.28]  Yeah, I will. I shouldn't need to do anything like that again.
[01:37:04.30 - 01:37:08.30]  From here on out, I'll try to find out what really happened in that forest that night.
[01:37:08.32 - 01:37:12.32]  Fluttershy forgave you, so I guess I can too.
[01:37:12.34 - 01:37:16.34]  A princess also said I can trust you. I'll try. No.
[01:37:16.36 - 01:37:18.20]  I won't let you down this time.
[01:37:18.22 - 01:37:19.02]  Thank you.
[01:37:19.58 - 01:37:21.32]  That spare bed is in the same place.
[01:37:21.34 - 01:37:23.26]  Try to get lots of sleep this time.
[01:37:23.28 - 01:37:25.80]  I'm pretty tired after all that's happened today.
[01:37:25.82 - 01:37:27.98]  Investigating sure takes a lot out of you.
[01:37:28.00 - 01:37:29.46]  Tell me about it.
[01:37:29.48 - 01:37:31.10]  I think I'm going to bed early.
[01:37:31.12 - 01:37:33.86]  Alright, I'm probably gonna crash soon as well.
[01:37:33.88 - 01:37:34.68]  Goodnight.
[01:37:35.52 - 01:37:38.42]  This whole situation was not as bugging me.
[01:37:38.44 - 01:37:42.20]  Not only her blackmailing, but her appearance.
[01:37:42.22 - 01:37:44.94]  Is only a coincidence she looks like her?
[01:37:44.96 - 01:37:46.96]  Or is that somehow really Mia?
[01:37:48.32 - 01:37:50.32]  Twilight says she may know who's behind the murder.
[01:37:51.04 - 01:37:54.54]  Perhaps I should just wait until tomorrow instead of stressing my brain about this.
[01:37:57.24 - 01:37:58.04]  Wait a minute.
[01:37:58.64 - 01:38:01.60]  Hey, Aloysius, do you think you can do me a favor?
[01:38:01.98 - 01:38:02.48]  Whoo!
