00:05       0100                    Ponyville District Court. June 10th, 9:45AM
00:16                   Phoenix     Coffee... need coffee...
00:19       0101        Twilight    I told you Phoenix, we didn't have any...
00:21       0102        Phoenix     That bed was way too small. I hardly got any sleep last night.
00:26       0101        Twilight    It wasn't designed for someone as tall as you.
00:28                   Phoenix     And I'm starving...
00:30                   Twilight    Spike and I offered you breakfast but you wouldn't eat it!
00:34                   Phoenix     Sorry, but I don't eat hay!
00:36       0103        Twilight    Stop whining!
00:38                   Phoenix     I am NOT whining, I'm complaining!
00:41                   .           Ugh, sorry Twilight, I'm just a bit nervous.
00:44       0102        .           (I feel like such a rookie right now; I'm going to be the only human being in that courtroom.)
00:50                   Twilight    I'm sorry too... the feeling's mutual.
00:55       0104        Rainbow     Hey!
00:57       0105        Phoenix     (Can't she just say "Hello" instead of blurting out "Hey!" like that?!)
01:02       0106        Rainbow     What's wrong with you two? I should be the one that's jumpy right now.
01:05                   Phoenix     Oh... *ahem*... that's right...
01:08       0104        Rainbow     ...So did you find any super awesome proof to clear my good name last night?
01:14       0107        Twilight    Uh...
01:16       0104        Phoenix     I wouldn't exactly call it "super awesome"... we did get a tip off of who will be testifying as a witness today, so we got that on our side.
01:24       0105        Rainbow     And who would that be?
01:26       0102        Twilight    Fluttershy...
01:28       0108        Rainbow     WHAT?! Why is she testifying against me?! She better not say anything dumb!
01:33       0107        Twilight    Calm down, Rainbow Dash. Fluttershy wouldn't do that...
01:37       0102        Phoenix     Twilight, do you know what the prosecuter is like?
01:40       0107        Twilight    The prosecutor? I forgot to look into that...
01:44       0102        Phoenix     (Speaking of prosecutors... I wonder what Edgeworth would do if he were in my shoes right now...)
01:52       0109        Edgeworth   This is just like that one episode of the Steel Samurai where he meets the Pink Princess!
02:05       0102        Phoenix     (Doctor, I'd like the part of my brain responsible for that image lobotomized please...)
02:11       0107        Twilight    Does it really matter what the prosecutor is like?
02:14                   Phoenix     Save a few, most of the prosecutors in my world are always stuck up, smug, and arrogant.
02:21       0110        Twilight    Don't worry, I don't think there is anypony in Equestria like that.
02:25       0102        ???????     HAHAHAHAHAHA!
02:28       0111        Twilight    Oh... no...
02:30       0112
02:32       0113        ???????     We meet again, Twilight SPARKLE.
02:35                   Phoenix     Friend of yours?
02:37                   .           (What's with the get up?)
02:39       0114        ???????     The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie is no friend of Twilight Sparkle!
02:44       0101        Twilight    What are you doing here, Trixie?
02:46       0114        Trixie      Come one! Come all! The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie will be displaying her PRODIGIOUS and CUNNING prowess as a Prosecutor in the courtroom today!
02:56       0111        Twilight    You're the Prosecutor?!
02:58       0112        Trixie      Trixie is a mare of many talents. Does it really come as a surprise?
03:02                   .           As soon as Trixie caught wind of one of your pathetic little friends performing such a heinous act, Trixie jumped all over the opportunity to humiliate them as you had humiliated Trixie.
03:14       0115        Rainbow     Who are you calling pathetic?!
03:16       0113        Trixie      Oh? Are you mad?
03:18                   .           Don't worry, the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie hears you're going to be having a nice long vacation on the sun -- that should get your mind off things!
03:27                   .           Bon voyage!
03:29       0108        Rainbow     Why you...!
03:31                   Phoenix     Rainbow Dash, don't let her rile you up; it could look bad for us...
03:35       0116        Trixie      And just what in Celestia's name are YOU supposed to be?
03:39                   Phoenix     Me? I'm Rainbow's defense attorney... Phoenix Wright.
03:44       0113        Trixie      What?! You?! Hahahaha!
03:47                   .           This should be easy if Trixie's opponent is to be this hairless ape.
03:51                   .           From what Trixie has gathered you are only here because "Twilight Screw-up" botched up a spell, HA!
03:58                   .           Trixie would never settle for a wretched-looking creature such as yourself as a Defense Attorney nor would Trixie blunder a simple summoning spell in the first place.
04:08                   Phoenix     Actually... Rainbow Dash, forget what I said. Go for it, make it hurt.
04:13       0108        Rainbow     Gladly!
04:15       0101        Twilight    Phoenix! Rainbow Dash! Stop it!
04:19       0102        .           Trixie, I didn't mean to humiliate you -- please don't take this out on my friends.
04:25       0116        Trixie      Hmph! It's too late for that...
04:27       0114        .           Now if you will excuse Trixie, she must prepare for her GRAND debut as an EXTRAVAGANT and BENEVOLENT Prosecutor!
04:37       0103        Twilight    Phoenix... you know what you said about Prosecutors being stuck up, smug, and arrogant...?
04:43                   Phoenix     Yes?
04:45       0107        Twilight    I guess we have those here in Equestria as well...
04:47                   Phoenix     Who was that?
04:49       0102        Twilight    She's a traveling performer named Trixie.
04:51                   Phoenix     I kind of got her name down a long time ago; she only said it about a dozen times...
04:56       0105        Rainbow     Actually, she only said it twelve times, not a dozen.
05:00                   Phoenix     Rainbow Dash, a dozen IS twelve.
05:02       0106        Rainbow     Oh, I didn't know that... it would have been easier if you had just said twelve.
05:06       0105        Phoenix     Ugh, anyway. How do you know that prosecutor, Twilight?
05:10       0117        Twilight    I didn't know her as a prosecutor, I don't even know when that happened...
05:14                   .           She came to Ponyville a while ago showing off her magical talents.
05:18                   Phoenix     Magical talents? Like magic tricks? She kinda looked like a magician judging by the attire.
05:23                   Twilight    Yes. Like me, she's a unicorn and she had a habit of running her mouth about her magical abilities, claiming she was the most magically gifted unicorn in Equestria.
05:33                   Phoenix     Running her mouth is kind of an understatement... She seemed to have some sort of grudge against you, what happened?
05:39                   Twilight    How should I put this... I-
05:41                   Rainbow     Twilight totally showed up that snob by fixing up a mess she caused!
05:44                   Twilight    Well... yeah...
05:46       0104        Rainbow     Trixie is just jealous because Twilight is better with magic.
05:49       0105        Phoenix     "The mighty don't flaunt their power. The sly eagle hides its claws."
05:54       0110        Twilight    Phoenix! I'm impressed; I didn't know you were into proverbs.
05:58                   Phoenix     Heh, what can I say?
06:00                   .           (I should really tell her I just stole that one from a video game.)
06:03       0104        Rainbow     So Nix, you think you can beat that stuck up braggart?
06:07                   Phoenix     (Talk about the pot calling the kettle black).
06:10                   .           You didn't do it, right? I am sure things will turn out fine.
06:14       0118        Twilight    This isn't Mr Wright's first murder trial, Rainbow -- he's a professional. If anyone can get you out of this, he can. No substitute for experience!
06:20       0104        Rainbow     Right!
06:22       0102        Phoenix     There is something bothering me though, Twilight...
06:26                   Twilight    What is it, Phoenix? Not getting cold feet, are you?
06:29                   Phoenix     No. It's just this court house looks almost exactly like the one in my world.
06:34       0118        Twilight    Of course it does. It was inspired from human architecture.
06:36                   Phoenix     Why would it be inspired off of human architecture? Seems a little unnecessary if you ask me...
06:41       0110        Twilight    Humans have a commendable sense of justice. The way you humans uphold the law is what must have inspired the designers of this court house.
06:48                   .           Our criminal justice system also resembles yours as well from what I've read, so you should feel right at home.
06:53                   Phoenix     I just hope justice swings in our favor today...
06:56       0102        Twilight    Do you really think the evidence we found will be enough...?
06:59                   Phoenix     I hope so...
07:01       0119        Twilight    Hey? What's this thing? I don't remember us finding this yesterday.
07:04       0120        Rainbow     Hey! That's the toy you were playing with yesterday, Nix.
07:08                   Phoenix     Huh? Oh yeah, that's mine. Must have got mixed up in the evidence we found.
07:12                   .           AND IT'S NOT A TOY!
07:14                   Rainbow     Haha! Whatever you say.
07:17       0121        Phoenix     Can you hand that over here, Twilight?
07:19                   .           (I should really keep a better eye on it, Maya will kill me if I lose it.)
07:22                   Twilight    Sure, here you go.
07:24       0122        (bad magic sound)
07:26                   Phoenix     Huh?
07:28       flash       .           What the?!
07:32       0105        Rainbow     Whoa! Are you two okay?
07:34       0123        Twilight    Phoenix, what was that?!
07:36                   Phoenix     I-I don't know, it's never done that before.
07:39       0107        Twilight    You still haven't told me what that thing is yet...
07:42                   .           That light it just emitted, it felt... mystical...
07:46       0102        Phoenix     It allows me to-
07:48                   .           (Should I really tell her what it does? It would be awkward if I told her I can see deep secrets people are hiding...)
07:54       0107        Twilight    It allows you to what?
07:56       0102        Phoenix     ...it allows me to have good luck... it's a good luck charm...
08:01       0104        Rainbow     You say "good luck charm" -- I say "toy"!
08:08                   Phoenix     (Don't forget who is defending you, Skittles.)
08:11       0107        Twilight    Here is your... charm. I guess we need all the good luck we can get today.
08:17       0102        Phoenix     Right...
08:18                   .           (That was odd, it flashing like that when Twilight picked it up... it looks fine, I hope it still works...)
08:26       0107        Twilight    Are you okay? You look a little worried...
08:31       0102        Phoenix     It's nothing...
08:33                   Guard       The Defense and its co-counsel are to make their way to the court room!
08:36       0110        Twilight    Okay, Phoenix, the trial is about to start. Do your best!
08:41                   Phoenix     (Forget about the Magatama, I have bigger problems right now. Even with what little time I had to prepare... I've got to try my best for their sake!)
08:50       black                   Ponyville District Court, Courtroom No. 1, June 10th, 10:00AM.
08:56       0124        (crowd sfx)
08:59       0125        (hammersfx)
09:01       0126        Judge       Court is now in session. Are both sides ready?
09:04       0127        Trixie      The Great and Powerful Trixie was born ready!
09:08       0128        Phoenix     The Defense is ready, your Honor...
09:10       0129        Phoenix     YOUR HONOR!?
09:12       0130        Judge       Mr Wright! Fancy meeting you here!
09:16       0131        Twilight    You know him Phoenix? That's great!
09:18                   Phoenix     B-but I thought... what's going on here?!
09:22       0132        Twilight    Last night while you were in bed the Princess contacted me about complications.
09:25                   Phoenix     Complications?
09:27                   Twilight    Originally Princess Celestia was going to preside as the judge, but the high council members were concerned that her verdict might be biased...
09:34       0130        Phoenix     But what's HE doing here?
09:36       0132        Twilight    I thought since we have a human defense attorney, I'd get a human judge as well. So I summoned "the greated human judge", and he's a really nice guy!
09:44       0133        .           He took the whole thing a lot better than you did. I would have told you that I summoned him, but I didn't want to wake you.
09:52                   Phoenix     You're kidding me...
09:54                   .           (Are you sure you didn't summon "the ficklest judge ever", Twilight?)
09:57                   .           (Oh well... as weird as this is, he seems to always give fair verdicts. I shouldn't be complaining.)
10:04                   .           But isn't this Princess the ruler of this country? Can't she just say "Too bad, I'm doing it anyway"?
10:10       0132        Twilight    Princess Celestia is our all powerful ruler, yes, but every political decision must go by the High Council first.
10:17                   .           They represent the best interests of the citizens of Equestria.
10:20                   .           Naturally this case went by them, and they wouldn't allow the Princess to reside as the judge...
10:25                   Phoenix     *sigh* that's democracy for you...
10:28       0130        Judge       Aren't these ponies just remarkable, Mr Wright? They have shown me nothing but a good time.
10:34       0134        Phoenix     All they've done for me is make fun of my hair...
10:37       0135        Trixie      Enough with this idle chit-chat. Trixie has a trial to win!
10:41       0126        Judge       Oh! That's correct, we have a trial underway. We'll have to catch up later, Mr Wright.
10:48                   .           I expect you are aware of the workings of Equestria?
10:51       0136        Phoenix     Eh? The workings?
10:54       0130        Judge       You see, this world operates a lot differently from our world.
10:59       0128        Phoenix     Twilight Sparkle here showed me a bit... but I figured it's almost like our world... just with talking ponies...
11:05       0126        Judge       No, no, Mr Wright! There are many amazing things these ponies do that are a far cry from the workings of our world.
11:14       0132        Twilight    This is why you should have studied!
11:16       0137        Phoenix     Ngh... Could you tell me about these differences, Your Honor?
11:20       0130        Judge       Well, Mr Wright, the first thing you should know is...
11:23       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
11:24       0135        Trixie      It's not our fault this bumbling buffoon didn't do any research! We shouldn't be holding up the trial because of his stupidity and negligence.
11:32       0139        Phoenix     Hey!
11:34       0126        Judge       I'm sorry Mr Wright, but the prosecution is right. You should have studied Equestria before jumping in to this case.
11:43       0140        Phoenix     Err- I'm sorry...
11:47       0132        Twilight    I'll try to keep you informed if we encounter anything that may work differently from your world.
11:52                   Phoenix     Alright, thank you.
11:54       0126        Judge       The trial will now commence!
11:56       0127        Trixie      Indeed, this drabble has wasted enough of Trixie's time.
11:59       0139        Phoenix     (That third person thing is really getting on my nerves.)
12:03       0126        Judge       Very well, the prosecution may make her opening statement.
12:07       0141        Trixie      About time...
12:09       0142        .           The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie would like to start off by saying the Defense has no chance of winning in this.
12:15       0143        .           Zero.
12:16                   .           Zilch.
12:17       0144        .           Nada.
12:18       0127        .           None!
12:20       0134        Phoenix     What kind of opening statement is that?!
12:22       0127        Trixie      In fact, Trixie finds it insulting she is not given a proper attorney to wage battle with.
12:28                   .           Instead she is forced to deal with this idiot...
12:30       0139        Phoenix     What's your problem?!
12:32       0126        Judge       Please refrain from personal attacks on the defense, Ms Trixie. Can you please just get on with stating your case?
12:39       0139        Phoenix     (There has to be some rule in the prosecutor handbook to be as unpleasant as possible.)
12:43       0143        Trixie      Hmph! Very well -- Trixie shall dazzle and enlighten you all on the events that transpired that fateful night!
12:49       0127        .           On June 8th at around the 20th hour, "Ace Swift", a famous pegasus athlete, was murdered in the Everfree Forest.
12:56       0141        .           Unfortunately we don't know why he was in such a place, but the Ponyville police force found his body there.
13:02       0143        .           And with the evidence and an eyewitness account they were able to find his killer: Rainbow Dash!
13:07       0124        (crowd sfx)
13:10       0126        Judge       Can you please share with the court the evidence that points to Ms Dash's guilt?
13:16       0144        Trixie      Certainly!
13:17       0132        Twilight    This is it, Phoenix!
13:19                   Phoenix     We'll finally have some light shed on what exactly happened!
13:22       0145        Trixie      Ace Swift was electrocuted and killed instantly as detailed in this autopsy report.
13:28       0130        Judge       Electrocuted?
13:29       0131        .           That is a peculiar way to die...
13:34       0136        Phoenix     Electrocution? But how? The crime scene was a clearing. I saw no electronic devices or anything of that nature.
13:41       0135        Trixie      Let Trixie finish, you dunce!
13:44       0139        Phoenix     Grrr...
13:45       0147        Trixie      There was also a fresh sizable burn mark on the back of the victim's neck. Unfortunately, we couldn't find the cause of it.
13:51       0136        Phoenix     (A burn mark? Hmm...)
13:53       0147        Trixie      That wasn't the cause of death, though. It was the electrocution that did him in.
13:58       0143        .           The investigators found decisive evidence pointing to Rainbow Trash as the assailant in this crime.
14:03       0130        Judge       And what was that?
14:05       0147        Trixie      A storm cloud found right above the crime scene is what we believe killed Ace.
14:10       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
14:11       0148        Phoenix     A storm cloud!? You call that decisive!?
14:15       0139        .           How could you place blame on my client for that!?
14:18       0149        .           Unless you are honestly suggesting Rainbow Dash can move clouds around and make them shoot lightning at will!
14:24       0124        (silence)
14:28       0149        Phoenix     (Why is everyone staring at me like that?)
14:31       0150        Twilight    Oh, Mr Wright...
14:33                   Phoenix     What's her problem, Twilight? She can't honestly think someone can control weather. It's ludicrous!
14:38       0135        Trixie      You have to be the biggest imbecile Trixie has ever laid eyes on!
14:42       0130        Judge       Mr Wright... that's a pegasus's job here in Equestria... It's sort of what they do.
14:50       0134        Phoenix     Mmmph... uh what...?
14:52       0132        Twilight    They schedule and control the weather, Phoenix. When it rains, snows, hails... that is all the pegasi's doing.
14:59       0137        Phoenix     Oh, sorry... my mistake...
15:04       0143        Trixie      Trixie knew you were incompetent - this THIS! Ha! This will be a walk in the park.
15:10       0151        Judge       The defense will refrain from any more outbursts or they will be reprimanded.
15:15       0140        Twilight    Maybe you should have, oh I don't know... STUDIED!
15:18                   Phoenix     I said I was sorry!
15:20       0143        Trixie      When a pegasus sets off a cloud, the first bolt will always strike directly under it.
15:25       0127        .           This particular storm cloud bore hoof markings of the rainbow colored loser in the defendent chair.
15:31       0152        Rainbow     I'll show YOU who's a loser, you two bit fraud!
15:34       0134        Judge       ORDER!
15:36       0127        .           ORDER IN THE COURT, I SAY!
15:38       0151        .           The Defendent will remain seated for the duration of the trial!
15:41       0150        Twilight    This is a disaster...
15:44       0143        Trixie      Naturally, the body was discovered directly under the storm cloud in question.
15:48                   .           Trixie believes this is a pretty open and shut case.
15:51       0126        Judge       As do I. There aren't many ways to be electrocuted in the middle of the forest.
15:57       0130        .           Well, there was that one incident when I was camping with the bug zapper.
16:01                   .           It nearly fried my beard off!
16:04       0136        Phoenix     (I never saw the Judge as an outdoors man.)
16:06       0139        .           I'd like to ask some questions!
16:09       0143        Trixie      Fine then, Mr Wrong... Ask away.
16:12       0139        Phoenix     It's Wright!
16:13       0128        .           First off, how were the police notified of the murder? It was in the middle of a forest, right? Who reported it?
16:19       0147        Trixie      It was quite peculiar, actually...
16:22                   .           Prior to the crime, the police received a vague tip that wished to remain anonymous.
16:27                   .           They are being questioned more thoroughly in the advent of the murder, though.
16:31       0128        Phoenix     What was this tip?
16:33       0143        Trixie      All they said was, "Something big is going down in the Everfree Forest!"
16:37       0134        Phoenix     That's it...?
16:39       0143        Trixie      Trixie told you it was vague.
16:41       0141        .           And due to the... "attitude" of this anonymous tip.
16:44       0143        .           The police didn't respond as quickly as they could have, since the tip failed to specify a time when "something big" was "going down".
16:52       0139        Phoenix     Isn't that negligence!? They could have saved someone's life!
16:55       0126        Judge       This is true, Ms Trixie. The police force should have responded to this tip more responsibly.
17:01       0141        Trixie      If you were to meet this individual, you'd take them as seriously as the police did.
17:07       0143        .           Any more questions, Mr Wrong?
17:09       0139        Phoenix     I told you, it's Wright!
17:11                   .           I do have some questions regarding that cloud though...
17:13                   .           How many times did this storm cloud strike?
17:16                   .           I noticed two charred areas that were quite a distance apart from each other on the crime scene.
17:20       0127        Trixie      Three times... after the cloud was activated by...
17:23       0152        .           You know who.
17:25       0143        .           the cloud operates by itself: gradually firing lightning wherever it wants, but never in the same place twice.
17:31       0127        .           It was only large enough to hold three bolts of lightning.
17:34       0136        Phoenix     Three?
17:36       0127        Trixie      The first bolt was directly under the cloud where the late Mr Swift lay.
17:40       0141        .           The second one... we don't know where it hit.
17:42       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
17:43       0148        Phoenix     Wait, then maybe-
17:45       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
17:46       0135        Trixie      Trixie knows what you are going to say and it's not going to work!
17:50       0143        .           The investigation team combed the entire perimeter of the crime scene and they didn't find any indication the bolt
17:56                   .           hit the ground or any trees in the storm cloud's proximity.
17:59       0141        .           It's truly a mystery where this bolt of lightning went.
18:01       0139        Phoenix     Hey! Then, what if it-
18:03       0144        Trixie      Ace was also wearing a lightning-proof suit that protects the body from lightning, standard issue for all participants of the Equestrian 500.
18:10       0143        .           It protects pegasi from lighting when flying at high altitudes.
18:13                   .           The only reason the first bolt killed him is because it was aimed with precision at one of his exposed parts, by Rainbow Trash.
18:20       0148        Phoenix     I think that-
18:21       0144        Trixie      If the second bolt hit Ace directly, it still would have touched the ground, leaving burn marks like the one under the cloud.
18:27       0143        .           Even if he were struck while in the air.
18:29       0126        Judge       The prosecution's logic is very sound so I must overrule the defense's claiMs
18:34       0134        Phoenix     But I didn't get to say anything!
18:37       0130        Judge       Fine then. What were you going to say, Mr Wright?
18:41       0137        Phoenix     mmmph... Exactly... what... she said...
18:45       0151        Judge       Then the defense's claims have been double-overruled.
18:48       0136        Phoenix     What about the third lightning bolt?
18:50       0141        Trixie      Since the storm cloud was important evidence, it was left on the scene undisturbed and the investigation team witnessed the final bolt take down a tree.
18:58       0144        .           east of the crime scene, as Trixie will show you on this diagram of the clearing.
19:03       0153        .           Right here is where the first lightning bolt hit - directly above the body. We know it was set off at 8:40PM.
19:10                   .           The second one is a mystery. We don't know where it touched down but we are sure a bolt of lightning left that cloud at 8:50PM.
19:17       0154        .           The third bolt touched down at 11:35PM when the investigation team was on the scene so we can completely rule it out of the crime.
19:25                   .           It just took down a tree right here.
19:27                   Phoenix     (So that's what happened to that tree...)
19:29       0155
19:34       0136        Phoenix     But how are you so sure of the time the first two lightning bolts touched down?
19:39       0144        Trixie      We were able to use cloud ballistics to confirm the second bolt left the cloud at exactly 8:50PM.
19:44       0139        Phoenix     ("Cloud ballistics"... you have got to be joking!)
19:48                   .           (I better not question it though, I don't want a penalty.)
19:51       0128        .           And the first?
19:53       0142        Trixie      That's where Trixie's eyewitness comes in!
19:55       0132        Twilight    It must be Fluttershy...
19:57       0127        Trixie      Since the first bolt is manually set off by a pegasus, cloud ballistics is unable to confirm when it was fired. But luckily, we have an eyewitness who saw it.
20:04       0130        Judge       I wish to hear a testimony from the witness. Please bring them out...
20:10       0144        Trixie      Very well...
20:15       0127        .           State your name and occupation please...
20:18       0156
20:20       0139        Phoenix     Huh?
20:22       0130        Judge       Um... where's the witness?
20:24       0156        ?????       I'm down here!
20:26       0132        Twilight    That voice...
20:28                   Phoenix     Who is that? I thought Fluttershy was going to be the witness?
20:32                   Twilight    I think that's my friend's kid sister. What does she have to do with this?
20:35                   Phoenix     Your guess is as good as mine...
20:39       0141        Trixie      Perhaps we should get some boxes for the witness to stand on...
20:42       0143        .           There, much better...
20:44       0157        ?????       Howdy!
20:46       0130        Judge       Awww, aren't you the most adorable little thing!
20:50       0127        Trixie      Now then, witness, state your name and occupation.
20:54       0157        Bloom       My name is Applebloom and 
20:56       0158        .           I'm a CUTIE MARK CRUSADER!
20:59       0130        Judge       A... cutie mark... what? I did my research of Equestria but I never came across anything regarding "Crusaders".
21:08       0132        Phoenix     What the heck is a "Cutie Mark Crusader", Twilight?
21:11                   Twilight    It's... um... it's hard to explain...
21:14       0127        Trixie      We were informed by a resident of the Everfree Forest that this little filly was walking home the night of the murder.
21:20       0143        .           Sure enough, she witnessed the first lightning bolt.
21:22       0141        .           The witness' occupation doesn't matter. What's important is what she-
21:25       0159        Bloom       What are you talking about?! It does matter!
21:28       0157        .           As a Cutie Mark Crusader, it's my duty to crusade my talents everywhere so I can earn my cutie mark!
21:34       0160        .           Even if one-third of the team is here!
21:36       0132        Phoenix     Ugh... I'm so confused. What on earth is a cutie mark? Is it the nickname of her boyfriend "Mark" or something?
21:43       0131        Twilight    A cutie mark is a symbol ponies earn when we find our special talent.
21:48                   .           For example, the stars on mine represent my expertise in magic and love for stargazing.
21:53                   Phoenix     That's just... strange.
21:56       0136        .           (Actually, I wonder what my cutie mark would be?)
21:59       0149        .           (Maybe a hand pointing an index finger filled with righteous justice! That would be amazing!)
22:04       0135        
22:07       0144        Trixie      Listen... "sweetie". Your job is to testify just like Trixie told you to earlier.   
22:12       0160        Bloom       Hey! What are you?
22:14       0128        Phoenix     Huh? Me?
22:16       0135        Trixie      STOP IGNORING THE GREAT AND POWERFUL TRIXIE!
22:18       0157        Bloom       Yeah, you. I've never seen anything like you before.
22:21       0128        Phoenix     I'm a human.
22:23       0160        Bloom       A human, huh? Is that your job?
22:26       0128        Phoenix     No, that's my species. I'm a lawyer, if you're wondering what my job is.
22:30       0160        Bloom       A lawyer? What's a lawyer?
22:32       0128        Phoenix     A lawyer argues, points, and theorizes to defend someone in trouble.
22:36       0160        Bloom       Your job is to... argue?
22:38       0136        Phoenix     Yes... I guess it's kind of like that...
22:41       0157        Bloom       I knew it! I knew it! There IS a cutie mark for arguin'!
22:45                   .           Wait till I tell Scootaloo. We were goin' about it all wrong! We can be...
22:50       0158        .           CUTIE MARK CRUSADER LAWYERS!
22:52       0134        Phoenix     (The future of criminal justice is looking pretty bleak right now.)
22:57       0135        Trixie      Witness! Let's get back on topic! Testify as to what you saw last night!
23:01       0159        Bloom       No... I'm losing valuable crusading time 'cause of you.
23:05       0160        .           This is boring...
23:07       0135        Trixie      W..what!?
23:09       0159        Bloom       I don't have to listen to you! You're that snotty show-off Applejack told me about.
23:13       0161        Trixie      SNOTTY?!
23:14       0135        .           Why you-!
23:16       0137        Phoenix     (You tell her, Applebloom!)
23:18                   .           (I'm actually kind of enjoying this.)
23:20       0135        Trixie      The defense will wipe that stupid grin off his ugly mug and the witness will cooperate!
23:25       0126        Judge       Witness, can you please testify for us? Then, you can do all the crusading you want. It won't take long at all.
23:34       0130        .           Besides, maybe you're a... OH! A CUTIE MARK CRUSADER WITNESS TESTIFIER!
23:39       0134        Phoenix     (Your Honor... how much shame do you have left after saying something like that?)
23:43       0157        Bloom       Hey! I think you're right, Mister! That cutie mark is as good as mine!
23:48       0141        Trixie      *Ahem* Alright witness, tell everypony what you told Trixie earlier.
23:53       0157        Bloom       Fine then...
23:55       0158        .           CUTIE MARK CRUSADER WITNESS TESTIFIER!
23:58       0162        (boomsfx)   -- Walkin' Home --
24:03       0160T       Bloom       I went to Zecora's place in the Everfree Forest to help her brew some stuff.
24:07       0163T       .           After we were all done, I walked home along the pathway.
24:10                   .           Just then, I heard a lightning bolt... It was... 8:40... but it didn't scare me!
24:17       0157T       .           Then, I found my way out of the forest and went on home.
24:22       0130        Judge       So there was indeed a lightning bolt around the time of death...
24:26       0151        .           Mr Wright, this isn't looking good for your client...
24:29       0139        Phoenix     Please, just let me cross-examine this witness, Your Honor...
24:32       0132        Twilight    She's a child, Phoenix. It might just be an overactive imagination.
24:36                   Phoenix     I don't think so. I think she is being vague, if anything.
24:39                   Twilight    Vague? Meaning she's not telling us everything?
24:43                   Phoenix     Precisely! I don't think this will be about finding a contradiction more than about digging out those extra nuggets of information.
24:49       0126        Judge       Alright, Mr Wright. You may cross-examine the witness.
24:53       0164        (trixie holdit sfx)
24:55       0144        Trixie      Before we begin the cross-examination-- Trixie knows all about sneaky underhanded tricks;
25:01       0143        .           If you dare press this innocent and fragile child too hard... you will be punished!
25:05       0165        Phoenix     W-What!?
25:07       0151        Judge       She's right! You better not hurt this sweet little one's feelings, Mr Wright!
25:12                   .           I know these tactics all too well! You will be forced to face the consequences if you do!
25:17       0134        Phoenix     (Children - the kryptonite of Phoenix Wright...)
25:22       0166        (boomsfx)
25:26       0160C       Bloom       I went to Zecora's place in the Everfree Forest to help her brew some stuff.
25:30       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
25:32       0136        Phoenix     Zecora? Who is this?
25:34       0157        Bloom       She's a zebra. A friend of mine who lives in the forest.
25:37       0134        Phoenix     (There are talking zebras here as well? Oh brother...)
25:41       0139        .           And you were helping her brew potions? What kind of potions?
25:45       0160        Bloom       I don't really know -- she just told me to gather some flowers and plants outside the house.
25:50       0127        Trixie      The zebra told us she was making herbal ointments and medicines...
25:54                   .           Nothing out of the ordinary.
25:56       0134        Phoenix     (I've heard it all.. a zebra brewing potions is "nothing out of the ordinary"...)
26:01       0139        .           So what did you do afterward, Applebloom?
26:03       0167        Bloom       Well...
26:06       0160C       Bloom       After we were all done, I walked home along the pathway.
26:09       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
26:11       0139        Phoenix     You walked home all alone? I heard that forest was dangerous.
26:15                   .           Definitely not the place for someone your age...
26:18       0130        Judge       Thank heavens she is alright. There are terrible creatures in that forest.
26:24       0167        Bloom       Truth is... I wasn't supposed to be in there that late...
26:28                   .           I got grounded when I got home.
26:30       0136        Phoenix     Serves you right for breaking your curfew...
26:32       0168 
26:35       0137        Phoenix     I-I MEAN, YOU SURE ARE A BRAVE COOTIE MARK CRUSADER!
26:39       0159        Bloom       Cutie Mark Crusader!
26:41       0151        Judge       Mr Wright, you are treading on VERY thin ice.
26:47       0132        Phoenix     I better be careful as to what I say to her.
26:49                   Twilight    Try not to be too hard on her, Phoenix.
26:51                   Phoenix     I'm kind of on a handicap here - not being able to squeeze information as I would normally do with any other witness.
26:57                   .           But I have dealt with children in the past and I can do it again.
27:00       0133        Twilight    Oh, so you have children? You don't really look like a father type.
27:04       0132        Phoenix     N-no, I don't have kids! I meant I've dealt with children testifying.
27:09                   .           (Me with children? That'll be the day.)
27:12       0151        Judge       If the defense is done with idle conversation... please continue your cross-examination.
27:19                   .           And remember. GENTLY, Mr Wright. Or else, you will hear my gavel banging an unfortunate fate for you.
27:26       0134        Phoenix     Y-yes, sir!
27:29                   .           (The judge is staring down at me like he has the intent to kill!)
27:32       0139        .           Okay, Applebloom. Please continue.
27:36       0163C       Bloom       Just then, I heard a lightning bolt... It was... 8:40... but it didn't scare me!
27:42       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
27:44       0136        Phoenix     How did you know the time?
27:46       0160        Bloom       Zecora's clock said 8:35 when I left and I had been walking for about five minutes.
27:51       0143        Trixie      That lines up exactly with the time of death.
27:54       0136        Phoenix     Why did you say "it didn't scare you"? No one asked you if it did...
27:58       0167        Bloom       Umm... I...
28:01       0160        .           Okay, maybe it scared me a little.
28:03       0139        Phoenix     A little?
28:05       0167        Bloom       Yeah, just a little, no big deal...
28:08       0139        Phoenix     I don't think you are being honest with me, Applebloom.
28:10       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
28:12       0135        Trixie      Mr Wrong is badgering this witness! Who cares if the lightning scared her! Penalize him!
28:17       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
28:19       0148        Phoenix     She isn't giving us all the details as to what she saw!
28:22       0169 
28:24       0126        Judge       I'll allow the defense to pursue this matter...
28:27       0151        .           But I'm warning you Mr Wright...
28:30       0134        Phoenix     Y-yes Your Honor, I understand...
28:33       0139        .           Applebloom, you need to tell the truth. Even if it may not seem like it, this is really important.
28:39       0167        Bloom       ...
28:41       0139        Phoenix     Someone's life depends on you telling the truth.
28:43       0160        Bloom       !!??
28:45                   .           Someone's life?
28:47       0139        Phoenix     Yes; if you don't tell the truth you may be ruining an innocent pony's life.
28:51       0167        Bloom       I-I don't want an innocent pony's life to be ruined...
28:54       0139        Phoenix     Then please tell us what really happened, Applebloom.
28:57       0160        Bloom       Fine... the lightning really scared me...
29:00       0139        Phoenix     What did you do?
29:02       0167        Bloom       The noise scared me and I ran off the path deeper into the forest...
29:05       0139        Phoenix     You ran off the path?
29:07       0160        Bloom       Yeah and I kinda got lost in the forest. I was really scared...
29:11       0126        Judge       The witness will amend this to her testimony.
29:14       0167        Bloom       Okay...
29:16       0160C       Bloom       After the lightning scared me I ran off the path and I got a little lost.
29:21       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
29:23       0136        Phoenix     How long were you lost?
29:25       0160        Bloom       I was in there for a really long time.
29:27       0136        Phoenix     How long exactly...?
29:29       0160        Bloom       ...
29:30       0139        Phoenix     ...
29:31       0160        Bloom       ...
29:32       0157        Bloom       A really long time!
29:34       0134 
29:36       0139        Phoenix     Okay, let's look at this a different way.
29:38                   .           What time was it when you got out?
29:40       0167        Bloom       Hmm... well, my house is ten minutes away from the Everfree Forest.
29:45       0160        .           So I guess I got out of the forest at exactly 9:00.
29:49       0141        Trixie      Her family can confirm she got home at 9:10...
29:52       0136        Phoenix     Interesting...
29:54                   .           So you were lost for twenty minutes -- that's quite a long time.
29:57       0167        Bloom       It was really dark in there, I couldn't see anything...
30:01       0139        Phoenix     (I remember it being extremely dark in there as well)
30:04       0160        Bloom       I could find my way out of the forest while on the pathway because I could feel the dirt road on my hooves.
30:09       0167        .           But once I was on the grass I couldn't tell left from right.
30:12       0139        Phoenix     So you just wandered blindly for 20 minutes?
30:15       0167        Bloom       Y-yeah... I thought I'd be lost in there forever.
30:18       0169        Judge       Do not fear little one, I'll defend you from all those horrible monsters in that dreadful forest with my gavel of truth!
30:26       0136        Phoenix     (The Judge vs The Everfree Forest, sounds like the title of a pay-per-view event...)
30:30       0167        Bloom       I was especially scared when I bumped into that thing...
30:33       0139        Phoenix     !!??
30:34                   .           What?
30:35       0130        Judge       You-you bumped into something?
30:38       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
30:39       0135        Trixie      Witness! This is the first time I'm hearing about this!
30:43                   .           Why did you not say anything to me regarding this earlier!?
30:45       0160        Bloom       Because I don't like you...
30:47       0161 
30:49       0170        Phoenix     Looks like Trixie is getting a dose of her own medicine.
30:52                   Twilight    Did Trixie just-
30:54                   Phoenix     What? What about her?
30:56                   Twilight    She just...
30:57       0132        .           Never mind, it's nothing important...
30:59                   Phoenix     If you say so, Twilight.
31:01       0136        .           I'd like to know more about this thing she bumped into.
31:03       0126        Judge       As do I; would you mind adding this to your testimony, dear?
31:09       0157        Bloom       Not a problem!
31:12       0160C       Bloom       All of a sudden I bumped into something.
31:14       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
31:16       0136        Phoenix     You bumped into something? What was it?
31:19       0167        Bloom       I don't have a clue... it was really dark, I couldn't see anything...
31:24       0139        Phoenix     You have to know more about this!
31:26       0160        Bloom       But I really don't know what it was, Mr Lawyer... honest...
31:31       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
31:32       0135        Trixie      Leave her alone, you jerk! She doesn't know what it was.
31:35       0148        Phoenix     This is important information! Just moments ago you said she never told you about this!
31:41       0126        Judge       I am curious as to what she bumped into as well... Objection overruled!
31:46       0161 
31:49       0141        Trixie      If you enjoy hearing pointless information... be my guest...
31:53                   .           It was probably just a tree or a rock. I think the defense is just hopelessly grasping at straws.
31:58       0170        Twilight    !!??
32:01                   Phoenix     (Why does Twilight keep randomly looking over at Trixie like that? I should ask her later... for now I have to focus on the matters at hand.)
32:09       0139        .           Okay Applebloom, just like how I asked you to think of a different way about how long you were lost...
32:14                   .           Let's think about this in a different way...
32:16       0160        Bloom       What do you mean?
32:18       0139        Phoenix     What did it feel like... what did the thing you bumped into feel like?
32:22       0157        Bloom       Oh... that's right!
32:24       0130        Judge       What is it, witness?
32:26       0160        Bloom       It felt alive... it wasn't a rock or a tree.
32:28       0136        Phoenix     Alive?
32:30       0130        Judge       It was... "alive"... please explain how you were able to deduce this...
32:36       0160        Bloom       I definitely felt fur when I bumped into it and I could hear it breathing heavy like it was really tired.
32:42       0136        Phoenix     It was... breathing? Could it have been a wild animal?
32:46       0167        Bloom       I'm not too sure; I know I heard it breathing heavy though.
32:50       0139        Phoenix     How did it react when you bumped into it?
32:52       0160        Bloom       When I bumped into the thing, it kinda jumped a bit.
32:55       0128        Phoenix     I would probably jump too if something bumped me in the dark...
32:58       0130        Judge       As would I...
33:00       0141        Trixie      Trixie wouldn't...
33:02       0142        .           Trixie is BRAVE and COURAGEOUS!
33:04       0139        Phoenix     (Oh, shut up!)
33:06       0160        Bloom       Almost right after there was another bolt of lightning.
33:11       0143        Trixie      That must have been the second one.
33:13       0160        Bloom       But the thing is, it didn't scare me... Really, honest this time...
33:17       0139        Phoenix     Why didn't it scare you this time?
33:20       0167        Bloom       I know this will sound strange...
33:23                   .           After it flashed... my eyes kinda hurt for a bit.
33:26       0136        Phoenix     That's not strange...
33:28       0139        .           Anyone's eyes would hurt if there was a sudden burst of light in pitch black darkness.
33:32       0167        Bloom       No, not that part Mr Lawyer, after that... I stumbled around for about a minute or two because I couldn't open my eyes.
33:39                   .           The flash of the lightning made my eyes sting... but when the hurting in my eyes went away...
33:45       0160        .           I was outside the forest... just like that.
33:48       0139        Phoenix     W-what!? But how?
33:51       0141        Trixie      There is only one way in and out of that forest and that is the entrance on the pathway.
33:56                   .           The trees surrounding the forest's outer perimeter act as a barricade; you can only leave and enter the Everfree Forest from the entrance.
34:03                   .           Unless of course you're a pegasus -- then you could just fly out.
34:06       0130        Judge       That is certainly strange...
34:09       0139        Phoenix     How could you go from being lost to being outside the forest just like that, Applebloom?
34:13       0167        Bloom       I know it sounds weird but it's true...
34:16       0160        .           I was outside the dark forest after the lightning hit. I went straight home afterwards and I got home at 9:10 like I said before.
34:23       0139        Phoenix     ... wait a minute... what did you just say?
34:26       0160        Bloom       I went straight home after I was outside the forest... because I was... y'know... scared...
34:33       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
34:35       0148        Phoenix     The prosecution has some explaining to do!
34:38       0141        Trixie      What are you babbling about?
34:40       0139        Phoenix     Applebloom claims she got out of the forest at exactly 9:00, when she saw the second bolt of lightning.
34:46       0141        Trixie      Yes? So what?
34:48       0161 
34:50       0171        Phoenix     I see you caught on -- according to these 'cloud ballistics' you said the second lightning bolt struct at ten to nine.
34:59       0139        .           So why did Applebloom see a lightning bolt ten minutes after that!?
35:01       0172        Trixie      Um well... uh... Maybe...
35:07       0157        Bloom       Cool!
35:09       0148        Phoenix     It couldn't have been the third one since that one struck after 11:00PM!
35:11       0126        Judge       Ms Trixie, this is a big oversight! Why is there a ten minute gap as to when the child saw the lightning bolt?
35:19       0172        Trixie      I'M THINKING! BE QUIET!
35:21       0130        Judge       Oh, o-okay...
35:24       0142        Trixie      The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie is done thinking!
35:29       0130        Judge       And...
35:31       0143        Trixie      Trixie wants the defense to explain what this means!
35:33       0139        Phoenix     Hey! You're just saying that because you don't know!
35:35       0143        Trixie      You're the one who brought up the inconsistency, therefore you should be the one to explain it!
35:40       0128        Phoenix     Very well...
35:42       0139        .           There are two possibilities to this: either what Applebloom saw wasn't lightning...
35:45                   .           or she is mistaken on the time; that is, if your 'cloud ballistics' are accurate.
35:51       0135        Trixie      They are accurate! To the second!
35:53       0141        .           And this filly's family can confirm she arrived at home at 9:10...
35:57       0144        .           So the prosecution is under the impression what little Applebloom saw was NOT lightning! That is Trixie's GREAT and POWERFUL theory!
36:05       0129        Trixie      What!?
36:07       0132        Twilight    I can't believe you just fell for that...
36:09                   Phoenix     But-but-I-She-stole-I...
36:12       0141        Trixie      It could have been a giant illumi-bear the child bumped into or something of that nature; many animals in the Everfree Forest have strange
36:19                   .           characteristics, including built-in lights.
36:22       0143        .           She probably bumped into it and just happened to be near the exit of the forest and stumbled out in her daze.
36:28       0144        .           The GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie has explained the inconsistency in this witness' testimony!
36:33       0130        Judge       You sure are very bright, deducing something like that, Ms Trixie.
36:37       0144        Trixie      Naturally!
36:40       0139        Phoenix     (Argh! That was my deduction!)
36:43                   .           There is still a problem, Your Honor!
36:45       0130        Judge       What is that, Mr Wright?
36:47                   .           Ms Trixie seems to have solved the mystery of the time inconsistency.
36:51       0139        Phoenix     But another mystery comes from that...
36:54       0126        Judge       Do tell, Mr Wright...
36:57       0139        Phoenix     The REAL second bolt of lightning -- why didn't Applebloom mention seeing or hearing that?
37:02       0126        Judge       Ah, you bring up a valid point, Mr. Wright. Witness...
37:06       0160        Bloom       Yes?
37:08       0130        Judge       Did you not see any lightning other than the one at 8:40PM that night?
37:14       0160        Bloom       I only saw that one at 8:40PM and the one after I bumped into that thing.
37:19       0126        Judge       This is most peculiar... Trixie, do you have an explanation for this?
37:28       0172        Trixie      Well... the Defense will-!
37:30       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
37:32       0148        Phoenix     Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me...
37:35       0139        .           I'm not going to fall for that again! Besides, remember?
37:38       0149        .           It's YOUR "GREAT and POWERFUL" theory, after all!
37:41       0135        Trixie      What do you take me for, a fool!?
37:43       0128        Phoenix     Why in fact, I do...
37:45       0161 
37:47       0132        Twilight    Low blow, Phoenix...
37:49       0135        Trixie      How DARE you...!
37:50       0151        Judge       Mr Wright, that was uncalled for...
37:54       0134        Phoenix     (Hey... she's been putting me down all day!)
37:57       0135        Trixie      Trixie will show you, you spiky headed ingrate! Do you remember why this witness is testifying?
38:03       0139        Phoenix     Yes, to confirm the time of the lightning bolt striking!
38:07       0135        Trixie      Exactly, which she did. Anything beyond that is trivial.
38:11       0126        Judge       Though it is suspicious... why this witness didn't testify to hearing or seeing the second lightning bolt, the fact still stands. The initial bolt was set off at 8:40PM.
38:23       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
38:26       0148        Phoenix     But the second bolt-
38:27       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
38:29       0141        Trixie      You seem obsessed with that -- perhaps the reason the witness didn't hear it is that she was too far away;
38:35                   .           the clearing is fifteen minutes away from the entrance. Maybe the sound didn't have enough volume to reach that far.
38:41       0126        Judge       I agree with the prosecution: the witness did what she came here to do. Objection overruled!
38:47       0139        Phoenix     Argh, no!
38:49       0126        Judge       Alright, this witness is free to go!
38:53       0158        Bloom       OBJECTION!
38:54                   .           HOLD IT!
38:55       0173        
38:56       0167        Bloom       Awww, nothing...
39:00       black
39:04       0126        Judge       The witness brought up some interesting information, but does the prosecution have anything more regarding the defendant?
39:11       0144        Trixie      Trixie has this weather schedule...
39:13       0136        Phoenix     Weather schedule? Like the forecast for each day? How is that evidence?
39:18       0132        Twilight    It's what the weather mare is given to know what weather to make in which areas of Ponyville.
39:22                   Phoenix     (I forgot about that...)
39:24                   .           (I still can't believe these ponies control weather... sounds like some sort of twist at the end of a Twilight Zone episode)
39:30       0142        Trixie      Lo and behold! Rainbow Trash was scheduled to make several lightning storms at the eastern end of Ponyville; this is where she got the cloud from.
39:39       0174
39:42       0126        Judge       The court accepts this as evidence.
39:45       0175
39:48       0139        Phoenix     (It's really starting to look like Rainbow Dash did it... but I can't give up!)
39:53                   .           What about motive?
39:55       0141        Trixie      Hmm?
39:57       0139        Phoenix     I was told murder almost never occurs in Equestria. What could drive my client to kill another?
40:01       0144        Trixie      Oh! That one is easy!
40:04       0126        Judge       Please explain, Ms Trixie.
40:06       0144        Trixie      Both the victim and the defendant were to participate in a monumental race called the "Equestrian 500".
40:11       0139        Phoenix     Damnit! She knows!
40:13       0132        Twilight    Phoenix! Language!
40:15                   Phoenix     Oh, sorry...
40:17       0127        Trixie      The victim Mr Ace Swift has quite the record, completely undefeated in every athletic event he has ever competed in.
40:23       0130        Judge       That is... impressive!
40:26       0127        Trixie      Indeed...
40:28       0143        .           Now Rainbow Trash was probably intimidated by this and decided to get rid of him like a coward, making it easier to win.
40:35                   .           She is the top pegasus athlete in Ponyville after all; she has a reputation to uphold.
40:40                   .           She then could reap the spoilt of the grand prize -- flight lessons from her idols, "The Wonderbolts".
40:46       0148        Phoenix     You have no proof that is what she was thinking!
40:49       0144        Trixie      So? You have no proof that WASN'T what she was thinking...
40:53       0143        .           Trixie doesn't need to establish a motive. How should Trixie know why she killed him? The point is Rainbow Trash did it.
40:59       0148        Phoenix     Let's hear your explanation of how the murder went down, then.
41:03       0144        Trixie      Very well...
41:06       0143C       .           Rainbow Dash went to the Everfree Forest...
41:08       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
41:10       0139        Phoenix     How can you be sure she was there?
41:12       0135        Trixie      Weren't you listening to what Trixie said earlier?
41:15       0144        .           The cloud above the crime scene had her hoof markings.
41:17                   .           On top of that, some cyan-colored feathers were found around the clearing -- three guesses who they belong to, Mr Wrong.
41:24       0139        Phoenix     (Rainbow Dash, what were you doing there...?)
41:26       0128        .           Okay, continue...
41:29       0143C       Trixie      She saw Ace hanging around the forest for whatever reason...
41:32       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
41:33       0136        Phoenix     Why would he be 'hanging' around that forest anyway?
41:36       0135        Trixie      That is of no concern to Trixie!
41:38       0139        Phoenix     That's ridiculous; he had to have a reason to go into that dangerous forest!
41:42       0176        Trixie      If you think it's so important, why don't you give us an explanation?
41:46       0139        Phoenix     I-I don't have one...
41:49       0176        Trixie      Thought so... now let Trixie continue...
41:52       0132        Twilight    Do you think it's important why he was in there?
41:54                   Phoenix     I know for a fact there must have been a good reason why he was in a place like that...
41:57                   .           I just don't know why yet... I wish I had more time to prepare...
42:02                   Twilight    I guess it's my fault for getting you on such short notice...
42:04       0177        Phoenix     We're not going to let that stop us though.
42:07       0133        Twilight    Right!
42:09       0128        Phoenix     Alright Trixie, continue your explanation...
42:10       0143C       Trixie      Rainbow Trash saw him at the clearing and an opportunity to permanently retire him from the race,
42:15                   .           gathered some storm clouds, and 'boom!' fried Ace SWift...
42:19       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
42:20       0141        Trixie      Don't point that ugly sausage of a finger at Trixie!
42:24       0128        Phoenix     You say Rainbow Dash scoped the victim in the Everfree Forest that night and saw an opportunity to murder him.
42:30       0135        Trixie      Are you deaf? Of course Trixie did! Trixie is always right!
42:34       0128        Phoenix     Blind...
42:36       0135        Trixie      What? Blind is not being able to see; deaf is not being able to hear, you idiot!
42:41       0139        Phoenix     No. Blind, that's how I felt in that forest last night. I couldn't see my hands in front of my face without a light source.
42:47       0161 
42:49       0139        Phoenix     Even Applebloom testified how dark it was.
42:52       0148        .           How could Rainbow Dash see Ace Swift in that darkness and plot to murder him on impulse?
42:55       0149        .           Explain that, Trixie, that is if "Trixie is always right"!
43:00       0161        
43:01       0133        Twilight    You got her, Phoenix!
43:03                   Phoenix     I just have to keep the momentum on my side now.
43:05       0126        Judge       Is the forest truly that dark at the hour of the night, Ms Trixie?
43:10       0172        Trixie      W-well yes...
43:12       0126        Judge       Then the defense has pointed out a flaw in your theory.
43:16       0135        Trixie      Why you...! Are you mocking me!?
43:19       0139        Phoenix     No, I'm just debunking your flawed theory.
43:22       0143        Trixie      Too bad Trixie has an explanation...
43:25       0139        Phoenix     Care to share it with us?
43:27       0176        Trixie      Rainbow Trash probably saw him enter the forest while he was still visible.
43:31       0143        .           Yes, that's it!
43:33       0126        Judge       That makes sense.
43:35       0176        Trixie      She then followed him to the clearing and performed the dastardly deed.
43:38       0141        .           It's dark in there, yes, but if you follow somepony from the entrance, it would be easy to track them using your other senses.
43:44       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
43:46       0148        Phoenix     Sorry Trixie, but that is impossible as well.
43:49       0172        Trixie      What do you mean!?
43:51       0148        Phoenix     You said Rainbow Dash was scheduled to cause a storm on the eastern end of Ponyville, where you say she got the storm cloud from.
43:57       0171        .           The Everfree Forest is in the west 
43:59       0174        .           according to this weather schedule you yourself submitted to this court!
44:02       0161        Trixie      N-no!
44:04       0139        Phoenix     There is no way my client could have flown to the other end of town and back to get a cloud while still tracking Ace in that dark forest.
44:10       0126        Judge       Mr Wright is correct. It would take some time to travel back and forth between the eastern and western ends of the town.
44:18       0172 
44:20       0176        Trixie      Thought you had Trixie there, didn't you?
44:22       0139        Phoenix     What?
44:24       0176        Trixie      Premeditated...
44:26       0139        Phoenix     You can't be seriously suggesting-
44:28       0176        Trixie      Yes, the defendant must have known he was going to be there, and unlike you, Mr Wrong...
44:32       0143        .           Trixie has proof!
44:34       0139        Phoenix     !!??
44:36       0142        Trixie      The Great and Powerful Trixie would like to submit this evidence!
44:40       0178        Judge       Hmmm... "Missing Cloud Report"?
44:44       0176        Trixie      Go on, read the rest, Your Honor...
44:46       0178        Judge       "Storm cloud missing at 4:00PM from eastern end of Ponyville. Weather mare in charge: Rainbow Dash"
44:56       0139        Phoenix     This can't be!
44:58       0143        Trixie      Take a guess where that missing cloud was found, Mr Wrong.
45:02       0142        .           Right above the Everfree Forest clearing!
45:06       0124        (crowd sfx)
45:08       0130        Judge       My word! So the defendant placed it there earlier? This makes all the defense's objections null and void.
45:18       0179
45:23       0176        Trixie      The defendant knew Ace was going to be in that forest, so she placed the cloud in that clearing well in advance.
45:29       0139        Phoenix     But how could she know he would be there!?
45:32       0176        Trixie      Trixie will say this again, Mr Wrong...
45:35       0143        .           Who cares? The fact is she did it and that is all that matters.
45:39       0139        Phoenix     What if some other pony moved that cloud!?
45:42       0127        Trixie      If that were the case, yes, you could argue another pony moved the cloud.
45:45       0143        .           But the only two ponies in the clearing that night were Ace Swift and Rainbow Trash. Unless of course, you have proof there was another, Mr Wrong.
45:54       0139        Phoenix     I don't right now!
45:56       0176        Trixie      Then it is to be assumed Rainbow Trash moved that cloud there in foresight that Ace would be there!
46:01       0126C       Judge       I have heard enough. With all the evidence supplied, I can safely hand down my verdict.
46:07       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
46:09       0148        Phoenix     No, Your Honor, there still might be something we're overlooking.
46:13       0127        Trixie      The prosecution agrees...
46:15       0139        Phoenix     (Huh? She is agreeing with me? Why?)
46:18       0127        Trixie      Trixie still has some more evidence.
46:20       0180        .           This!
46:22       0136        Phoenix     What is that?
46:24       0180        Trixie      We found this in the victim's bag on the crime scene. A little burnt considering what happened, but the contents are still unharmed...
46:30       0181
46:32       0182        Rainbow     Huh!? NO! Please put that away!
46:35       0180        Trixie      The contents of this envelope are quite shocking... no pun intended.
46:39       0182        Rainbow     I'm begging you! Please don't open it!
46:41       0139        Phoenix     whatever is in that envelope really has Rainbow Dash spooked... what on earth is in there?
46:46       0142        Trixie      Filles and Gentlecolts! Trixie will now reveal to the courtroom what secrets this mysterious envelope holds!
46:53       0182        Rainbow     Please don't do it, Trixie!
46:55       0139        Phoenix     (I have a bad feeling about this. I hope whatever is in that thing doesn't hurt Rainbow Dash's case even more...)
47:02       black
47:05                   (laughsfx)
47:08       0183        (laughsfx)  Wow! Rainbow Dash, who would have thought!
47:12       0143        (laughsfx)
47:15       0134        (laughsfx)  I didn't know you were into that kind of stuff, Rainbow Dash!
47:20       0130        (laughsfx)  M-my sides hurt!
47:25                   Judge       My word... these are... certainly...
47:30       0126        .           Ahem. Interesting... photographs...
47:34       0134        Phoenix     Oh dear...
47:36       0184        Twilight    P-poor Rainbow Dash...
47:39       0185        Rainbow     My life is ruined!
47:42       0143        Trixie      As you can see, the defendent has some very bizarre tastes.
47:47       0139        Phoenix     Wait! What was the point in showing these pictures? How do they relate to the crime in question?
47:52       0176        Trixie      They were in the victim's bag, weren't they?
47:55                   .           They are important evidence! Do you think Trixie would be so low as to show these pictures for the sole purpose of humiliating the defendant?
48:03       0139        Phoenix     (That is exactly what I think you did!)
48:06                   .           What were pictures... like... these... doing on the victim anyway?
48:11       0141        Trixie      How should Trixie know?
48:13       0139        Phoenix     (You said these pictures were important evidence, and you're not going to explain why?)
48:17                   .           (Now I know you just brought them out to embarrass Rainbow Dash.)
48:20       0126        Judge       In any case, the court accepts these... um...
48:25       0130        .           photos as... evidence...
48:27       0186
48:30       0126        Judge       After that little sideshow... can I declare my verdict now?
48:36       0176        Trixie      Most certainly, Your Honor!
48:38       0132        Twilight    Phoenix, do something quick!
48:40                   Phoenix     To be honest... I don't know WHAT to do!
48:42                   .           I've never encountered first degree murder with a storm cloud before.
48:46                   Twilight    You said you wing it all the time, right? Well, wing it!
48:48       0126C       Judge       In the case of Ms Rainbow Dash...
48:50       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
48:52       0130        Judge       What is it, Mr Wright?
48:54       0139        Phoenix     How are you so sure my... um... my client was at the scene of the crime?
48:59       0128        .           If I recall correctly, she was picked up at her house... not on location.
49:03       0141        Trixie      Trixie already explained that, you imbecile.
49:06                   .           Her hoof marks were on the cloud and her feathers were all over the place. You don't think that's incriminating enough?
49:11       0148        Phoenix     Yes, but the cloud could have been moved by someone else and feathers could have been gathered from anywhere, just as hair falls from your head.
49:18       0139        .           I may not have proof yet, but it is a possibility!
49:21       0141        Trixie      Looks like this is going to drag out a bit longer.
49:25       0176        .           Trixie has another witness that can confirm the defendant was indeed at the scene of the crime on the night of the murder.
49:31       0132        Phoenix     This one HAS to be Fluttershy.
49:33                   Twilight    I wonder what she saw...
49:35                   Phoenix     We're about to find out in any case...
49:37       0126        Judge       The prosecution will bring out their next witness.
49:40       black
49:42       0127        Trixie      Witness, state your name and occupation.
49:46       0187
49:48       0135        Trixie      Witness! Get out from under there and state your name and occupation!
49:51       0188        Fluttershy  (*whispers*)
49:54       0130        Judge       Can you please repeat that, young lady? I couldn't hear you.
49:59       0188        Fluttershy  (*whispers*)
50:01       0130        Judge       Nope... still couldn't hear you...
50:03       0132        Phoenix     Maybe I can milk this situation to our advantage.
50:06                   Twilight    What do you mean?
50:08       0139        Phoenix     Your Honor! This witness clearly doesn't have the ability to testify. Perhaps we should suspend the proceedings of this trial for another-
50:15       0189        Fluttershy  Oh, Mr Phoenix, you're here. You haven't died yet?
50:18       0190        .           There must be something very wrong... you look so frail and seem to be suffering more than ever right now.
50:24       0134        Phoenix     You got the last part right...
50:26       0126        Judge       Mr Wright, tell her to state her name and occupation, please.
50:30       0128        Phoenix     But that's the prosecution's job. It's her witness...
50:34       0141        Trixie      This witness was being difficult when Trixie was preparing her earlier as well.
50:39       0126        Judge       Given the circumstances... just do it, Mr Wright.
50:43       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy - I mean, witness - state your name and occupation, please.
50:47                   .           (Never thought I'd be saying that line.)
50:49       0189        Fluttershy  I'm Fluttershy. I'm an animal caretaker.
50:53       0127        Trixie      Is it true you saw Rainbow Dash leave the Everfree Forest two nights ago?
50:58       0187
50:59       0126        Judge       Mr Wright...
51:01       0134
51:03                   Phoenix     Is it true you saw Rainbow Dash leave the Everfree Forest two nights ago?
51:07                   .           (This kind of backfired on me...)
51:09       0191        Fluttershy  Yes, she seemed to be in a hurry.
51:12       0130        Judge       So the defendant was indeed at the scene of the crime on the night of the murder.
51:17       0126        .           Witness! You will-
51:18       0187
51:19       0126        Judge       Mr Wright, tell her she has to testify.
51:24       0134        Phoenix     (Now I have to do your job too, Your Honor?)
51:27                   .           Fluttershy...
51:29       0189        Fluttershy  Yes, Mr Phoenix?
51:31       0139        Phoenix     Can you please testify as to what you saw two nights ago when you saw Rainbow Dash leaving the forest?
51:36       0190        Fluttershy  Umm... I don't know what 'testify' means...
51:40       0139        Phoenix     It just means tell us what you saw that night.
51:42       0189        Fluttershy  Oh yes, I can do that! Anything for you, Mr Phoenix!
51:46       0192        (boomsfx)   -- I'll tell you all what I saw! ... if it's okay with you... --
51:50       0191T       Fluttershy  It was during the night hours. I went outside to feed the chickens and the other ones...
51:57       0190T       .           When I was near my chicken coop, I heard a lightning bolt in the distance and it scared me.
52:04       0193T       .           After I finished feeding my chickens, I saw Rainbow Dash flying away from the forest like something was chasing her. I called out to her, but I don't think she heard me.
52:16                   .           I looked up but saw nothing following her.
52:19       0191T       .           That was when the police ponies arrived. They spoke with me, and I went off to bed at 10:30PM.
52:28       0176        Trixie      Hahaha! Is that isn't an airtight testimony, Trixie doesn't know what is! By Rainbow Trash's own friend no less.
52:36       0191        Rainbow     FLUTTERSHY!
52:38       0189        Fluttershy  Hi Rainbow Dash.
52:39       0126        Judge       Very well, Mr Wright, your cross-examination, if you please.
52:44       0132        Twilight    Did you see anything odd in there, Phoenix?
52:47                   Phoenix     Not really... Trixie is right.. it's kind of airtight...
52:50                   Twilight    Then what do we do?
52:52                   Phoenix     Poke holes in it until it isn't airtight anymore.
52:55       0133        Twilight    That's the spirit! I just hope Fluttershy isn't lying about anything.
52:59       0132        Phoenix     (I actually hope she's lying so I have something to work off of.)
53:02       0194
53:07       0191C       Fluttershy  It was during the night hours. I went outside to feed the chickens and the other ones...
53:13       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
53:14       0139        Phoenix     So, you say you went outside to feed your chickens, and "the other ones". What do you mean by that?
53:20       0189        Fluttershy  I'm... taking care of a lot of exotic animals right now.
53:23       0136        Phoenix     I see. How did you acquire them?
53:26       0189        Fluttershy  A zoo in Fillydelphia is, well, renovating, and they needed a place for all the animals to stay while they do it.
53:33       0191        .           They... heard about my talent with animals, somehow, and they came to me and asked me to take care of them.
53:42       0189        Fluttershy  O-of course I said 'yes', since they had lots of birdies and critters that I've never seen before, and I always like to meet new animals...
53:50       0136        Phoenix     How long have you had these animals?
53:52       0189        Fluttershy  Three days now.
53:54       0136        Phoenix     Is it hard work taking care of them all?
53:56       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
53:58       0135        Trixie      What, pray tell, does this have to do with murder?
54:01       0137        Phoenix     Well... I kind of like animals too, and...
54:03       0135        Trixie      Stop going off topic, you incompetent fool!
54:06       0139        Phoenix     (I really hate you Trixie, you know that?)
54:10                   .           (I better keep note of these exotic animals, though, something about it...)
54:13       0190C       Fluttershy  When I was near my chicken coop, I heard a lightning bolt in the distance and it scared me.
54:19       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
54:21       0139        Phoenix     You heard thunder while you were in your chicken coop?
54:23       0190        Fluttershy  Well, it was lightning...
54:25       0139        Phoenix     No, Fluttershy, thunder produces the sound, not lightning.
54:29       0143        Trixie      Wrong again, Mr Wrong...
54:31       0139        Phoenix     For the last time, Trixie, it's "Wright". Would you please stop calling me that?
54:35       0132        Twilight    Actually, here in Equestria, lightning is what produces the noise when it strikes the ground.
54:41       0139        Phoenix     That wasn't what I wanted to say, anyway. What time was it when you heard it?
54:45       0191        Fluttershy  8:40PM, on the dot.
54:47       0136        Phoenix     That's quite exact. How are you so sure?
54:49       0189        Fluttershy  It's the time I feed my chickens every night.
54:53       0134        Phoenix     Feeding chickens... at night...?
54:55       0190        Fluttershy  Midnight snack! I couldn't send them to bed without one, what if they starved to death while they were sleeping!?
55:02       0130        Judge       Oh my! I never realized the importance of midnight snacking!
55:07       0132        Twilight    That's our naive Fluttershy...
55:10                   Phoenix     (And that's my clueless Judge...)
55:12       0139        .           Are you positive it was the lightning you heard, and not something else?
55:15       0190        Fluttershy  I'm sure it was lightning, because the sound of lightning really frightens me!
55:20                   .           I remember getting scared when I heard it; I nearly dropped all of my chicken feed.
55:25       0127        Trixie      This lines up with the time of death, and when the initial lightning bolt was set off.
55:29       0193C       Fluttershy  After I finished feeding my chickens, I saw Rainbow Dash flying away from the forest like something was chasing her. I called out to her, but I don't think she heard me.
55:39       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
55:41       0139        Phoenix     How long did it take you to feed your chickens, Fluttershy?
55:44       0190        Fluttershy  Um, about 15 minutes.
55:47       0139        Phoenix     And you're saying you saw Rainbow Dash fleeing from the forest at that time?
55:50       0191        Fluttershy  Yes. I thought there was a ferocious creature chasing her, judging by how fast she was flying.
55:56       0139        Phoenix     What did you do then?
55:57       0190        Fluttershy  I called out to her at the top of my lungs so I could see what the problem was.
56:01       0136        Phoenix     And she just ignored you?
56:03       0190        Fluttershy  Yes, I don't know why... I yelled so loud, at the top of my lungs, like this...
56:07       0195
56:10       0196        Fluttershy  (softly) "Rainbow Dash, what's wrong!?"
56:14       0134
56:16                   Phoenix     Yeah... I haven't the faintest idea how she didn't hear that...
56:20       0139        .           So, you didn't see anything chasing Rainbow Dash?
56:23       0191        Fluttershy  Yes. I watched the forest until the police arrived, but I didn't see or hear anything come out of it after Rainbow Dash.
56:31       0139        Phoenix     !!??
56:33       0132        Twilight    What is it, Phoenix?
56:35                   Phoenix     I think I just found a contradiction...
56:37                   Twilight    You mean, Fluttershy is lying?
56:39                   Phoenix     I don't know why, but something she said is impossible.
56:41                   Twilight    Impossible?
56:43       0139        Phoenix     Your Honor, can you please have the witness amend that statement to her testimony?
56:46       0126        Judge       Hmmm... I don't see why not. Witness, please add your previous statement to your testimony.
56:53       0190        Fluttershy  Um... okay...
56:56       0191C       Fluttershy  I didn't see or hear anything else come out of the forest that night.
57:01       0164        (phoenix holdit sfx)
57:02       0139        Phoenix     Fluttershy, are you absolutely sure about this?
57:06       0191        Fluttershy  I'm sure. Not a peep or pony came out of that forest until the police came and spoke with me... then I went to sleep at 10:30PM.
57:14       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
57:16       0187
57:17       0126        Judge       Mr Wright, please don't frighten the witness.
57:21       0137        Phoenix     Right... sorry, but there is a contradiction in this testimony.
57:25       0141        Trixie      What contradiction? Everything she has said meshes with the evidence to a T!
57:30       0139        Phoenix     No, there's one thing that isn't right. Fluttershy, you said you watched the forest until the police force arrived, correct?
57:36       0187        Fluttershy  Y-yes... did I do something wrong? I'm so sorry if I did...
57:41       0134        Phoenix     Uh... no need to be sorry...
57:44       0139        .           But you didn't hear or see ANYTHING come out from the forest?
57:48       0191        FluttershyI didn't see or hear anything else come out of the forest that night.
57:53       0148        Phoenix     Then there's clearly a contradiction here... actually two!
57:57       0126        Judge       Please explain what these contradictions are, Mr Wright.
58:01       0139        Phoenix     Fluttershy should have seen someone leave the forest...
58:04       0148        .           The previous witness, Applebloom!
58:06       0130        Judge       Oh! That's right!
58:08       0161
58:09       0190        Fluttershy  But I-I didn't see Applebloom... I-I promise!
58:13       0148        Phoenix     You see, Fluttershy... you HAD to have seen Applebloom if you were really watching the forest all night...
58:13                   .           The prosecution even confirmed that there's only one way in and out of that forest... and that entrance is right by your cottage!
58:25       0172        Trixie      Ngh!
58:26       0132        Twilight    ...I don't understand, why would Fluttershy lie like this...?
58:30                   Phoenix     I don't know either. We've got to pursue this issue, otherwise we're cooked.
58:34       0190        Fluttershy  I-I don't know why, but I didn't see her...
58:38       0139        Phoenix     It's not just that; there is another thing, Fluttershy --
58:42                   .           You also stated you HEARD nothing as well. Earlier I was told lightning makes a noise when it hits the ground in Equestria.
58:49       0130        Judge       Yes, that is right, Mr Wright.
58:52       0148        Phoenix     Then why didn't Fluttershy mention hearing the second bolt of lightning?
58:55       0139        .           Fluttershy says she watched the forest until the police arrived, and they witnessed the third bolt take down a tree firsthand.
59:01       0148        .           The second lightning bolt is unaccounted for.
59:04       0190        Fluttershy  I only heard one bolt of lightning, though...
59:08       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
59:09       0135        Trixie      Maybe she just forgot about it.
59:11       0138        (phoenix objection sfx)
59:13       0148        Phoenix     She stated the first bolt of lightning scared her, from which we can conclude that every bolt of lightning could have been heard from Fluttershy's cottage.
59:20       0139        .           It's very clear this witness is afraid of lightning.
59:25       0134        .           (And everything, for that matter.)
59:27       0191        Fluttershy  Yes, it's true, lightning scares me! It is so loud and scary -- 
59:34       0187        .           like that voice you just did, Mr Phoenix.
59:37       0149        Phoenix     There you go, Trixie, she would have remembered the second bolt of lightning frightening her if she had heard it.
59:42       0139        .           Also, let's not forget, Applebloom didn't mention seeing or hearing this lightning either, now that we know that the lightning could've been heard from that far away.
59:50       0130        Judge       The defense has a point.
59:52       0143        Trixie      Heh, and Trixie thinks the defense has nothing.
59:55       0130        Judge       Excuse me?
59:58       0176        Trixie      So what, she didn't see Applebloom; what does that prove? Do tell, Mr Wrong, Trixie is all ears...
00:05       0139        Phoenix     It questions the credibility of your witnesses! You said it yourself; there's only one way in and out of that forest!
00:12       0141        Trixie      Remember another thing! Anything beyond what Applebloom said after the time she heard the lightning bolt is irrelevant!
00:18       0148        Phoenix     You can't say that this is irrelevant information when your witness didn't see your other witness leave the forest!
00:23       0135        Trixie      Then tell the GREAT and POWERFUL Trixie WHAT it means!
00:27       0176        .           Trixie knows one possibility, but that's up to you to say what it is, Mr Wrong. That is, if you have the guts to...
00:33       0139        Phoenix     I... I... can't...
00:36       0176        Trixie      Heh, thought so...
00:38       0197        Twilight    What is she talking about, Phoenix? You know a reason why Fluttershy didn't see Applebloom?
00:43                   Phoenix     I do, but I can't say it...
00:45                   Twilight    Why not?
00:48                   Phoenix     I just can't, Twilight. I'll be safe and just use the other contradiction as my stead for now.
00:53       0139        .           Fine, forget that! We can't overlook this second bolt of lightning, though. It could have been the real cause of death, making all this just an accident.
01:02       0141        Trixie      Didn't you hear Trixie earlier?
01:04       0139        Phoenix     Huh?
01:06       0141        Trixie      Lightning doesn't strike the same spot twice in Equestria, just as you can't divide by zero. The body was found directly under where the first bolt had struck.
01:15       0143        .           Not to mention the odds of a stray bolt of lightning hitting the victim by chance are highly improbable, especially since he was wearing a lightning-proof suit.
01:23       0132        Phoenix     I remember her bringing up this 'lightning-proof suit'...
01:27                   Twilight    It's what the pegasi wear when working with weather.
01:30                   .           Or in this case, a modified version designed for large scale races where they may encounter dangerous weather conditions.
01:35                   Phoenix     How exactly does the suit work?
01:38                   Twilight    It's a two piece suit, worn on the head and body. The fabric is made up of an effective insulator that protects pegasi from being harmed by lightning.
01:45                   Phoenix     Then how did he die if he was wearing this suit?
01:48                   Twilight    There are some parts of the body that the suit does not cover, namely certain parts of the head and neck. A precise, aimed bolt could still hit him in the sweet spots, which is what Trixie is basing her claims on...
02:00       0148        Phoenix     But it's still possible for a random bolt to hit him in one of the exposed spots!
02:04       0143        Trixie      I'm surprised you haven't realized it yet, Mr Wrong...
02:07       0139        Phoenix     Huh?
02:09       0135        Trixie      You have been babbling about Trixie's witnesses not seeing the second bolt of lightning so much that you seem to have forgotten...
02:15       0172        .           The second bolt seems to not exist at all. Trixie will be sure to have a chat with the pegasi who gave her these cloud ballistics to confirm it, Trixie assures you.
02:24       0143        .           Even if we take your silly theory into consideration, the odds of him being struck down by a random bolt of lightning are too low to be believable without having
02:32                   .           some sort of concrete proof!
02:34       0126        Judge       The prosecution's logic is very sound.
02:36                   .           The chances of a lightning bolt hitting the victim by chance are too small to hold water in this court without any proof,
02:43                   .           considering the protection he was wearing.
02:45       0151        .           Objection overruled!
02:48       0139        Phoenix     No!
02:50                   .           (Every time I make an objection she has it refuted just like that!)
02:53       0143        Trixie      Hah! Too bad, Mr Wrong.
02:57       0151        Judge       Enough! I'm afraid the defense's line has run short. Do you have anything else you would like to say, Mr Wright, before I hand down my verdict?
03:08       0139        Phoenix     (I'm going to lose if I don't do something fast!!)
03:13       0132        Twilight    Phoenix, there has got to be something we can do! It can't end like this!
03:18                   Phoenix     I know, but I need more time. I need more information!
03:23       0141        Trixie      Please Your Honor, make this quick. Trixie is starting to feel sorry for this hopeless defense team.
03:29       0198        Phoenix     (There is one thing I can do... I didn't want to do it earlier...)
03:33                   .           (But I have no choice...)
03:35       0199        .           (I need more time and evidence... this is the only way...)
03:37       0148        .           Your Honor!
03:39       0130        Judge       Yes, Mr Wright?
03:41       0139        Phoenix     The defense would like to cast suspicion on another.
03:44       0130        Judge       Another suspect?
03:46       0139        Phoenix     Yes, that is correct, Your Honor.
03:49       0197        Twilight    But who?
03:51       0143        Trixie      Is this the last bastion of Mr Wrong? Haha, let's hear it -- who is this mystery suspect?
03:57       0139        Phoenix     I am far from being done, Trixie!
04:00                   .           The suspect the defense accuses is the witness...
04:02       0148        .           Fluttershy!
04:04       0191        Fluttershy  Huh?
04:05       0132        Twilight    Mr Wright! What are you doing!?
04:07       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy is a pegasus; therefore she could have tampered with the cloud and the crime scene.
04:12                   .           And let's not forget, there was a very large time frame where Fluttershy was alone;
04:16                   .           She even stated she didn't see Applebloom leave the forest when we all know she SHOULD have!
04:21       0190        Fluttershy  B-but I was watching it the whole time... I'm not lying...
04:26       0143        Trixie      Heh...
04:27       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy also has connections with my client;
04:30                   .           She could have been the one who took the storm cloud my client was scheduled to set off, as well as gathered loose feathers to spread around the crime scene.
04:36       0190        Fluttershy  I-I didn't do that...
04:39       0200        Twilight    Phoenix! Stop this! She didn't do it!
04:42       0130        Judge       But the defendant's hoof marks were on the storm cloud, Mr Wright... how do you explain that?
04:49       0139        Phoenix     I'd be surprised if they WEREN'T there, Your Honor...
04:52       0130        Judge       Hmm, I don't follow...
04:55       0171        Phoenix     Simple. Rainbow Dash was to put those storm clouds at the eastern end of Ponyville, according to this weather schedule.
05:01       0130        Judge       Oh!
05:03       0139        Phoenix     Of course her hoofprints are there -- she was just doing her job!
05:06       0148        .           Fluttershy could have come and taken one of the clouds with marks on it, set it off and removed her own markings from the cloud...
05:12       0139        .           That is possible... right?
05:14       0141        Trixie      Yes, one could wipe a cloud... of their hoofmarks...
05:17       0148        Phoenix     Then all the more reason to suspect her!
05:20       0190        Fluttershy  I was home all day though...
05:22       0200        Twilight    Phoenix, you're supposed to be defending my friends!
05:26       0130        Judge       What about the dark forest, Mr Wright? How would this witness have been able to see in it?
05:32       0139        Phoenix     It must be like a backyard to her.
05:34                   .           She can probably navigate it from memory, just as you can probably navigate your house with your eyes closed.
05:39       0201
05:41       0126        Judge       This is a very bold claim, Mr Wright. This meek little thing looks like she wouldn't harm a fly... why would she frame her friend?
05:50       0191        Fluttershy  It's true, I have ten pet flies! Michael, Donna, Steven, Eric, Jackie...
05:58       0139        Phoenix     Easy! To cover her own guilt!
06:00                   .           Besides, as the prosecution has stated, why she did it is irrelevant; the fact still stands, she is just as suspicious as Rainbow Dash!
06:09       0200        Twilight    I-I can't believe you're saying this! I trusted you!
06:12       0126        Judge       You're going to need more proof to accuse this witness, Mr Wright. Do you have any evidence that can place her on the crime scene?
06:20       0139        Phoenix     In fact I do, Your Honor.
06:23       0148        .           This!
06:24       0130        Judge       A feather? Does it belong to her?
06:27       0139        Phoenix     No, I found this feather at the crime scene. It's way too big to belong to any bird or pegasus pony in Ponyville.
06:34       0130        Judge       Just what are you getting at, Mr Wright? How does this relate to the witness?
06:39       0148        Phoenix     Fluttershy!
06:40       0188        Fluttershy  Y-yes, Mr Phoenix...?
06:42       0139        Phoenix     Do you allow any of your exotic animals to go into the Everfree Forest?
06:46       0191        Fluttershy  Oh no, it is much too dangerous in there. They're kept locked up tightly when I'm not playing with them...
06:53       0139        Phoenix     As I thought! Fluttershy stated earlier that she's caring for animals not native to Ponyville; this feather could belong to one of them.
07:00       0148        .           It could have been brought there unintentionally by Fluttershy as she framed my client!

07:06       0130
07:07       0141
07:08       0202        Twilight    This can't go on!
07:11       0130        Judge       The.. defense is objecting to...
07:15                   .           ITSELF!?
07:16       0202        Twilight    Yes. Mr Wright doesn't know what he's talking about! His words are nothing but slander and lies!
07:23                   Phoenix     Twilight!
07:24       0138        (trixie objection sfx)
07:25       0135        Trixie      Zip it, Twilight! You're only his co-counsel, and nothing more!
07:29       0141        .           Discrediting an attorney like that will get you held in contempt!
07:33       0202        Twilight    You're a hypocrit! You've been degrading him all day long!
07:37       0176        Trixie      And that's it. Trixie has just called Mr Wrong names -- 
07:40       0143        .           never once has Trixie accused him of lies or slander, which is a serious accusation!
07:46       0126        Judge       You are right as always, Ms Trixie. 
07:49       0169        .           Another outburst by the defense's co-council and they will be held in contempt of court.
07:53       0177        Twilight    B-but...
07:55                   Phoenix     (Trust me, I don't want to do this, Twilight... but it's the only way I can buy more time...)
07:59       0126        Judge       Back to the matter at hand... I still have a hard time believing this little pony would do something like this...
08:07       0148        Phoenix     The evidence speaks for itself, Your Honor! This feather puts Fluttershy on the scene of the crime!
08:13       0139        .           I demand further investigation to find out if this feather belongs to any of Fluttershy's animals!
08:17       0201
08:20       0126        Judge       Ms Trixie, what is your opinion on all of this? You have been surprisingly quiet regarding all of Mr Wright's claims.
08:27       0141        Trixie      You know what...
08:29       0143        .           Trixie agrees, Fluttershy is suspicious.
08:32       0176        .           The investigation team did indeed see this feather on the crime scene; we brushed it off as just a plain old bird feather.
08:38       0141        .           but as Trixie's feeble opponent has pointed out, it does seem kind of big up close, and with this information regarding these zoo animals,
08:46       0190        .           it does seem to cast suspicion over this witness.
08:49       0126        Judge       You are aware we will have to suspend proceedings until tomorrow for further investigation...?
08:55       0135        Trixie      You don't think Trixie knows this?
08:57       0141        .           Another one of Twilight Sparkle's little friends in the slammer is reward enough for Trixie today. "Two for the price of one", as they say!
09:05       0143        .           And Trixie has you to thank, Mr Wrong!
09:09                   .           You've made this experience much, MUCH more fulfilling. 
09:12       0176        .           Perhaps Trixie will give you a voucher for her next performance.
09:14       0139        Phoenix     ...
09:16       0126        Judge       All proceedings for this case will be suspended until tomorrow.
09:20                   .           Baliff, please take the suspect into custody for questioning.
09:24       0190        Fluttershy  Wait, w-where are you taking me? I wouldn't do that to anypony... 
09:27       0156        .           Twilight, Mr Phoenix, help!
09:32       0177        Twilight    Phoenix... how could you...?
09:36       0139        Phoenix     (What have I done...?)
09:39       0126        Judge       I expect both sides will gather more evidence for tomorrow.
09:43       0176        Trixie      Trixie shouldn't need to if they are planning to keep that second rate lawyer over there!
09:48       0139        Phoenix     ...
09:50       0126        Judge       Court is now adjourned!
